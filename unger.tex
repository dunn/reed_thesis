\section{Unger's nihilism}
\label{unger}
Just as resolutely as we denied the existence of ghosts, so Peter
Unger has denied the existence of such things as ``tables and chairs
and spears\,\ldots\,swizzle sticks and sousaphones\,\ldots\,stones and
rocks and twigs, and also tumbleweeds and
fingernails''~(\citeyear[117]{unger1979}).  He does not consider them
merely `subjectively real' as opposed to objectively so---like van
Inwagen, he claims that they simply do not exist.  He comes to this
conclusion from a different direction, however.  As we will see, van
Inwagen's denial of the existence of `ordinary things' is a
consequence of his theory of composition (under what conditions some
things compose another thing).  Unger, on the other hand, draws his
conclusion from an application of the sorites paradox:
%
\footnote{Unger also motivates his nihilism by way of `the problem of
  the many'.  We will examine this problem in section~\ref{many}.}
%
\begin{squote}
Consider a stone, consisting of a certain finite number of atoms.  If
we or some physical process should remove one atom, without
replacement, then there is left that number minus one, presumably
constituting a stone still\,\ldots\,after another atom is removed,
there is that original number minus two; so far, so good.  But after
that certain number has been removed, in similar stepwise fashion,
there are no atoms at all in the situation, while we must still be
supposing that there is a stone there.  But as we have already agreed,
if there is a stone present, then there must be some atoms\,\ldots\,I
suggest that any adequate response to this contradiction must
include\,\ldots\,the denial of the existence of even a single
stone.~\citep[121--122]{unger1979}
\end{squote}

Having made this denial, Unger must either explain how our beliefs
about stones should be understood (van Inwagen has his paraphrasing
strategy) or he must deny that we really {\em do} have any beliefs
about stones.  It appears that he selects the latter option: Unger
seems to claim that, like the person who thought they had a belief
about a ghost, we are wrong to think that we have any coherent beliefs
about stones or any other ordinary things.  Unger says that, like
`ghost', our ``terms for ordinary things are incoherent [and] cannot
apply to anything real''~\citep[147]{unger1979}.  A consequence of
this is that our language and thought concerning all such things is
directed toward {\em nothing at all}: ``it may well be that I have
never {\em thought of} any stones at all, or tables, or even human
hands.  If that is so, then it would seem that {\em a fortiori} I do
not {\em know} anything {\em about these entities}, however commonly I
might otherwise suppose''~(\citeyear[458]{unger1980a}).

This all seems very strange.  Concerning ghosts, ``it is difficult
even to find a fully coherent belief that might be exposed as false;
we discover, at best, obscurity or perhaps confusion\,\ldots\,do we
really understand what sort of thing a ghost is supposed to
be''~\citep[76]{stroud2000a}?  If someone tries to tell me about the
ghost that visited him the previous night, it does not seem unjust to
say that he doesn't really know what he is talking about.  But can
this be extended to some of the most common objects of experience?

When we denied the existence of ghosts, we denied also others' beliefs
in them.  We did not, however, deny that people have beliefs which
they take to be about ghosts.  But we were able to show that these
beliefs were not {\em about} ghosts; in most cases they were about
nothing at all.  Likewise, Unger cannot deny that we have beliefs that
we take to be about tables, chairs, and all the other things that he
denies exist.  If our beliefs about tables and chairs are really
beliefs about nothing at all, there are two questions that must be
answered: first, what causes us to form these beliefs?\ and second, if
the utterances containing these empty terms are about nothing at all,
how do we manage to communicate so effectively using them?

\subsection{Causes of belief}
\label{unger-cause}
People who believe in ghosts probably do so because they have
unreflectively embraced the superstitions of their culture.  They may
initially come to believe that ghosts exist on the testimony of other
people---older siblings, perhaps---or by reading too many ghost
stories.  Much as Catherine in Jane Austen's {\em Northanger Abbey}
jumps to the most macabre conclusions as a result of having absorbed
too many gothic novels, so might our gullible reader of ghost stories
interpret such innocent phenomena as reflections of the moon as
ghostly assailants.  Those of us who have not taken our cues from
fiction would be more likely to recognize such phenomena as tricks of
the light.  Even if we were to see something that was definitely {\em
  not} a trick of the light, we would sooner attribute it to an
hallucination than countenance the possibility of ghosts.  Suppose
{\em you} saw what you took to be a ghost in an empty, well-lit room.
Most of us would still, even if presented with such a vision, {\em
  refuse to believe in ghosts}.  This is because we know that the
probability of there being such spirits is far less than the
probability of us experiencing cracks in our sanity.  Undermining my
belief that ghosts don't exist would require a great deal---for
example, my friend and I both seeing the {\em same} apparent ghost at
the same time, and knowing that we were each experiencing the same
vision.  (Even then, we would want further confirmed sightings to
convince us that we weren't, in fact, crazy.)

If this is an accurate characterization of our beliefs concerning
ghosts, it is a very different characterization than one we might give
of how we learn about and come to believe in chairs.  Chairs are not
something that children learn about from stories.  A child learns what
a chair is as an answer to the question, ``What is {\em that?}\,''  Let
us suppose that the child is pointing at a chair in the center of a
well-lit room containing no other furniture.  The chair is clearly
visible.  If someone were to believe they were pointing at a ghost in
a similarly well-lit situation, we could safely assume that they would
be experiencing a hallucination.  Hallucinations are not shared
experiences; if one person is hallucinating a ghost, nobody else can
see that ghost, not even if they were {\em also} hallucinating a ghost
(they can't both hallucinate the {\em same} ghost).  Such a ghost
sighting, therefore, would necessarily be experienced by a single
person.  A chair, on the other hand, can be sighted by multiple people
simultaneously.  The parent sees the same chair that the child sees.
This is what allows the parent to answer the child's question
(``That's a chair'') and this is how the child learns about chairs.
We learn about chairs by coming upon them in the world, and being {\em
  told} what it is we have come upon.  This brings us to
communication.

\subsection{Communication and incoherence}
\label{unger-comm}
A consequence of Peter Unger's thesis is that most of our
communication is empty of content, if not entirely incoherent.  For me
to warn my friend of a low-hanging tree branch, I must refer her to
it.  For her to heed my warning, she must recognize my intention to
refer to the branch in question, and, as a result of that intention,
herself come to think of the branch (and then duck).  But according to
Unger, ``when we are under the impression that we are thinking about
an object in the world\,\ldots\,our impression is
mistaken''~(\citeyear[149]{unger1979}).  Unger is denying that I can
ever possibly warn my friend about a low-hanging branch.

This seems plainly false.  For, after all, my friend ducked.  She
heard my warning and avoided the low-hanging branch.  Unless we are to
suppose that it was sheer luck that she moved her head in time to
dodge the branch, we must conclude that I did, in fact, warn my
friend.  If I did, in fact, warn my friend, then we both thought of
the branch.

That ought to be enough to prove Unger wrong.  Just to be thorough,
however, let's return to our well-lit room.  There is a chair in the
center of it.  A child and her parent enter.

\stage{Child}{(pointing at the chair)}{What's that?}
% recognizing the intention vs recognizing the object of the intention
Now, if the parent is going to be in a position to understand the
question, she must recognize the intention of the child to refer to
the chair; recognizing this intention, she comes herself to think of
the chair.  Only if this process occurs can the parent know what the
child means by ``that''.  Having performed this feat, the parent can
then tell the child ``That's a chair''.  If the child was
hallucinating the chair (if the room was really empty), then the
parent could not recognize the referential intention of the child.
She could not recognize a referential intention, because that would
require her to think of the object that the child is thinking of (and
intending to refer to).  But as I have argued, the child, if
hallucinating a chair, has a belief about {\em nothing} in particular.
The parent cannot come to think {\em of} the child's hallucination, at
least not as a result of recognizing the child's referential intention
(she may come to think {\em that} her child is hallucinating, but
that's a different matter).  Rather, she will look at an empty room
and say

\stage{Parent}{}{What's what?}

But if the room is not empty, and the child is not hallucinating, then
the parent {\em will} recognize the child's referential intention.  If
the child is referring to a chair, then the parent will say ``That's a
chair''.

How is Unger supposed to explain their communication? The child,
according to Unger, has no determinate thought; she is certainly not
thinking of a {\em chair}.  Nor is the parent thinking of a chair.
Unger might say that, just as people see things (reflections of the
moon) that they mistakenly take to be of a ghost, so the child and
parent are seeing something that each mistakenly takes to be a chair.

But now what could they be seeing? This is a well-lit, sparsely
furnished room.  There is no chance of curious plays of the light or
visual tricks that might deceive the child and her parent.  If the
child claimed to be seeing a ghost in such a room, then (as above) we
should have to say that she is hallucinating.  Is the child then
hallucinating a chair? If this were the case, then (as above) we
should not expect the parent to understand the referential intention.
Yet she apparently does.  Are {\em both} of them hallucinating? That
would allow us to say that communication appears to succeed when in
fact it does not.  But for the parent and child to have such similar
hallucinations is incredibly unlikely.  It may happen on rare
occasions, but to say that such a coincidence is actually a daily
occurrence is absurd.  There is clearly {\em something} that the
parent and child are communicating about.  The default assumption is
that it is a chair.

\subsection{Loose truth}
\label{loose-u}
One sympathetic to Unger's thesis might admit that they are
communicating about something, but deny that the subject of their
communication is a chair.  This philosopher would take refuge in the
notion of `loose truth'.  She would maintain that it is strictly false
that there is a chair in the room, but that it is loosely true; it is
close enough to the truth for practical purposes.  These practical
purposes include the communication we have observed above.  She will
appeal to such examples as this:

\stage{Countess}{}{Where on earth am I going to find someone to invest
  in my eel farm?}

\stage{Count}{(pointing)}{There's a millionaire for you.}

\stage{Countess}{(incredulous)}{Henry? A millionaire? He hasn't got
  above nine hundred ninety-five thousand pounds.}

\stage{Count}{}{Oh? Well, it's close enough.}

We are supposing that there is no millionaire in the room; strictly
speaking, the count said something false with ``There's a
millionaire''.  Nonetheless, communication occurred because the term
`millionaire' made the count's referential intention clear: he
intended to refer to a person who was {\em almost} a millionaire.
(The term is regularly used to refer to non-millionaires who have
relatively great wealth.)  The Ungerian is claiming that this is
analogous to the case of the parent and child.  Strictly speaking,
what the parent said (``That's a chair'') was false, but it allowed
for communication by making the parent's referential intention clear.

Is this a coherent objection?  Without concerning ourselves too much
with the nature of loose truth, I think it is fair to claim that, just
as a (strict) truth has a `truthmaker', so a loose truth must have a
`loose-truthmaker'.  In the example above, the truthmaker for
``There's a millionaire'' would have been the fact that the count was
referring to a millionaire.  This fact did not obtain, so the
statement is, strictly speaking, false.  The loose-truthmaker is
evidently the fact that the count is referring to someone who is {\em
  almost} a millionaire.  (What counts as `almost' will no doubt vary
between contexts, but in this context I am supposing it is true that
Henry is almost a millionaire.)

The truthmaker for ``That's a chair'' must obviously be the fact that
the parent is referring to a chair.  According to Unger, there are no
chairs, so nobody can refer to them.  The parent's statement would
therefore be, strictly speaking, false.  Now what is the
loose-truthmaker for the parent's use of ``That's a chair''?  It cannot
be the fact that there is {\em almost} a chair (a partially built
chair?), at least not if that entails that there could ever be a
chair.  Unger maintains that the kind of object picked out by `chair'
is ``never instanced''~(\citeyear[147]{unger1979}).  Is there,
perhaps, something closely resembling a chair in the room, and the
parent is referring to {\em that} thing instead?  This raises two
objections of its own.  First, what is there in the room that
``closely resembles'' a chair, other than the chair itself?  Second, if
we cannot ever have coherent thoughts about chairs (and therefore
cannot know anything about chairs), how are we supposed to know what
resembles a chair?

I do not think there are satisfactory answers to these questions.
Moreover, I do not think Unger ever espoused a `loose-truth' nihilism,
so we are not slighting him by moving on.

%\stage{Peter Unger}{}{I never said the room was {\em empty}.  It isn't empty.  But that doesn't mean that there is a {\em chair} in the room.  There's something else entirely.}
%
%\noindent Now we may ask, ``What {\em is} in the room, if not a chair?'' Unger might walk over to the chair, saying ``There seems to be a concentration of solid matter in this vicinity which, when placed appropriately, may be sat on.'' And now we say, ``Oh, you mean a {\em chair!} That's what it's called, you see.''

\subsection{The moral}
\label{moral}
There are limits to what one can resolutely deny the existence of.  We
can deny that certain things, like ghosts, exist {\em and} deny that
people have beliefs in them.  We can do this because in each situation
where a person has a belief about what they take to be a ghost, we can
show that their belief is really about nothing at all.  If someone
sees a reflection of the moon or experiences a hallucination, and so
thinks she is seeing a ghost, we can say that she is afraid of nothing
at all.  Under no circumstances must we say that her belief is really
about a ghost.  Moreover, we can explain how people come to believe in
ghosts---they read too many ghost stories, or believe the lies of
others.

This is not something we can do with tables, chairs, and other
``ordinary things'', let alone people.  For one, Unger has no
explanation of how we come to form our beliefs in these things, if not
by {\em seeing them}.  Secondly, to deny that our thought and talk
about such things are really about nothing at all is to deny that
communication regularly occurs.  Bizarrely, this is a consequence
Unger appears willing to accept:
\begin{squote}
Now, it must of course be admitted that these arguments [for his
  strain of nihilism] undermine the possibility of any endeavor I
should try to propose, or even the putative thought that I should
propose anything, just as all of my putative essay is undermined.  But
even so, I shall (incoherently) propose that what we have now to do is
invent new expressions which are not inconsistent ones, and by means
of which we may, to some significant extent, think coherently about
concrete reality~(\citeyear[544]{unger1980b}).
\end{squote}
If Unger seriously believes this, then he could not expect us even to
understand his essay ({\em why would he write it?}).  But I think it
is safe to say that Unger does {\em not} actually believe that there
are no people or ordinary things.  In a book on ethics, Unger has
unambiguously expressed his belief in people:

\begin{squote}
Each year millions of children die from easy to beat disease, from
malnutrition, and from bad drinking water\,\ldots\,As UNICEF has made
clear to millions of us well-off American adults at one time or
another, with a packet of oral rehydration salts that costs 15 cents,
a child can be saved from dying soon~(\citeyear[3]{unger1996}).
\end{squote}
There are only two possibilities: either Unger does believe that
people (at least children and Americans) do exist, or he takes himself
to be flat-out lying in the quoted passage.

As far as other ordinary things go, Unger claims to ``often now
believe that there really are no tables or rocks, and never so firmly
believe that there are such things as I once
did''~(\citeyear[543]{unger1980b}).  All I can say is that I don't
believe him.  (To show that he does believe in these things, we would
need to spend some time with him, observing his behavior.  We could
invite him for a walk along a trail with lots of low-hanging branches,
then warn him about them.)

\section{The problem of the many}
\label{many}
In section~\ref{unger} we looked at a version of metaphysical
nihilism.  Peter Unger attempted to deny that any of the `ordinary
things' in the world (tables, chairs, apples, people, \&c.) actually
exist.  His motivation for this claim was drawn from an apparent
paradox involving the terms for ordinary things.  If we have a stone,
then removing one atom of matter will not destroy the stone.  Nor will
removing another atom.  But if we remove enough atoms, there will not
be a stone.  One solution to this puzzle is to deny that there ever is
a stone.  But this, we have seen, is not workable.

Another solution is to claim that there are {\em many} stones where we
once thought there was only one.  The motivation for this claim
sometimes comes from what Unger calls ``the problem of the many''.
There are a number of different formulations of this problem.  Van
Inwagen nicely summarizes one:
\begin{squote}
Assume I exist.  Then certain simples compose me.  Call them `M'.
Now, a single simple is a negligible item indeed.  Let $x$ be one of
these negligible parts of me---one that is somewhere in my right arm,
say.  Now consider the simples that compose me {\em other than} $x$
(`M -- $x$').  Since $x$ is so very negligible, M -- $x$ {\em could}
[my emphasis] compose a human being just as well as M could.  We may
say that M and M -- $x$ are ``equally well suited'' to compose human
beings.  And, of course, for {\em any} simple $y$, ``M -- $y$ will be
as well suited to compose a human being as M are.  Moreover, it would
be surprising indeed if there were not a simple $z$ such that ``M +
$z$'' were as well suited to compose a human being as M are.  It
would, in fact (if I may once more use this phrase), be intolerably
arbitrary to say that M composed a human being although M -- $x$ {\em
  didn't} [my emphasis] and M -- $y$ {\em didn't} [my emphasis] and M
+ $z$ {\em didn't} [my emphasis].  Suppose, therefore, that M -- $x$
et al.\ {\em do} [my emphasis] compose human
beings~(\citeyear[215]{inwagen1995}).
\end{squote}

I think this formulation is problematic.  We are supposing that M does
compose a human being.  But it does not immediately follow from this
that M -- $x$ also composes a human being.  As I have pointed out with
italics, there is a slide from the claim that M -- $x$ {\em could}
compose a human being to the claim that M -- $x$ {\em does} compose a
human being.  As an analogy, take a house of blocks.  Suppose that the
blocks do compose the house.  Is there also something composed by the
blocks minus one? There {\em could} be; but intuitively, there would
be only if that one block were removed.  Then we would have a house
with a missing roof.  But we do not obviously have that second thing
already, without having removed the block.

Van Inwagen understands there to be a number of additional premises
required for this argument.  He formulates them thus:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item In every situation of which we should ordinarily say
          that it contained just one man, there are many sets of
          simples whose members are as suitably arranged to compose
          men as any simples could be.  \label{many1}
	\item The members of each of these sets compose
          something.  \label{many2}
	\item Each of these ``somethings'' is a man, provided there
          are any men at all.  \label{many3}
	\item If I exist, there is a
          man~(\citeyear[216]{inwagen1995}).  \label{many4}
\end{enumerate}
I think only~\ref{many4} is uncontroversially true.  There are many
difficult questions raised by~\ref{many2}, and I'm not sure how to
answer them.  I'm quite sure, however, that the first and third
premises are false.  These two are closely related, so we'll examine
them together.

\subsection{Problems with the first and third premises}
\label{many13p}
Unger begins his presentation of the problem of the many by directing
our attention to a cloud; looking at the edge of the cloud, ``all that
is there to be seen is a {\em gradual transition} from the more dense
[concentration of water molecules] to the less so\,\ldots\,there is no
natural break, or boundary, or stopping place, for any would-be cloud
to have''~(\citeyear[415]{unger1980a}).  Therefore any boundary we
choose for the cloud will be somewhat arbitrary.  A minutely larger or
smaller boundary would be just as `suitable' for bounding a cloud;
``if our alleged typical item [the cloud] is indeed a typical cloud,
then many of these candidates, millions at least, do not fail to be
clouds altogether but are clouds of some
sort''~(\citeyear[421]{unger1980a}).  Unger draws the conclusion that
either there are millions of such things there, or none.  This
argument can be generalized to chairs, stones, and people.  Regarding
chairs, at least, we have already shown that the conclusion that there
are none is false; perhaps then, there are millions of chairs in our
well-lit room.  But there are two problems with this argument.

\paragraph{An objection regarding communication.}
First, the idea of there being millions of objects where we supposed
there was only one poses a problem for referential communication.  In
fact, it is quite the same problem that Unger's nihilism faced above:
how is referential communication possible under this hypothesis? When
we supposed that there was nothing being referred to by `chair', we
were at a loss to explain how people nonetheless managed to
communicate using that term.  Now we are supposing there to be
millions of chairs, each eligible to be referred to by ``that chair''.
What needs explaining now is how, if there are millions of chairs that
might be referred to, how two speakers can be sure that they are
talking about the {\em same} chair.  When the child points and says
``What's that?'', the parent knows that the child is pointing at {\em
  a} chair, but how is she to determine {\em which} chair the child is
referring to? The child did {\em not} say ``What are those?'' because
she took herself to be referring to {\em one} chair, and expressed her
referential intention accordingly.

Even if the parent and child got lucky and happened to think of the
same chair, how would they know it? If there really were millions of
chairs in the center of the room, it seems implausible to suggest that
anyone could distinguish between each of them.  There would be nothing
the parent or child could do to make it clear to the other which of
the millions of chairs they meant to refer to.  Indeed, they could not
make it clear to themselves.  If I am holding a rock in my hand,
``there are millions of ``overlapping stones'' before me\,\ldots\,how
am I to think of a single one of them, while not then equally thinking
of so many others''~\citep[456]{unger1980a}?  Unger's brand of
universalism, like his nihilism, precludes successful communication,
and so must be rejected.

\paragraph{An objection regarding boundaries.}
Second, it seems to be simply false that all boundaries drawn about a
cloud are equally arbitrary.  If a cloud is a concentration of water
molecules in the air, then the boundary of the cloud is the edge of
the concentration, beyond which the level of water in the air is
normal.  There are not millions of clouds with millions of different
boundaries; any stipulated boundary that falls inside or outside the
actual boundary is arbitrary because it does not track the
concentration of water molecules.  For simples to be `suitably
arranged' so as to compose a cloud, their boundary must be the edge of
the concentration of water molecules.  I'm not sure, but it may be
possible to extend this argument to cover most `ordinary
things'---tables and chairs (and even people) have molecular
boundaries.

Premise~\ref{many1} is therefore false.  For clouds, at least, it is
not true that there are ``many sets of simples whose members are as
suitably arranged'' to compose them.  These closely related sets do
not have boundaries that track the concentration of water molecules in
the air, so they are not suitably arranged to compose clouds.  If the
boundary of the cloud shrunk, then a smaller set of molecules {\em
  would} be suitably arranged to compose the cloud, and so it would.
But just as the blocks minus one {\em would} compose a house (but
don't), so this smaller set {\em would} compose a cloud (but doesn't).
So premise~\ref{many3} seems false too; at least, if these sets
compose anything, they compose something other than a cloud.
