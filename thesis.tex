\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Paul Hovda has patiently worked with me all year.  If there is
anything in this thesis that is true, it is thanks to him.  If the
rest is at least false, that too is due to his help.

Andrew Dunn and Stuart Sherwin gave me feedback on drafts, helping me
clarify arguments and eliminate errors.

A short conversation with Nat Tabris helped me see better the
structure of Section~\ref{parts}, which resulted in a much clearer
argument.

Lauren Cary and Joe Arriaga looked after me while I recovered from a
back injury; without them I may not have finished this thesis.

My parents, of course, are the ones who gave me this opportunity in
the first place.

\chapter*{Abstract}
Theories of metaphysical nihilism claim that there are no (or nearly
no) objects with parts: no chairs, houses, mountains, and perhaps even
no people.  The philosophers who make these claims have trouble
explaining why we nonetheless believe there are such things.  The only
successful explanation is compatible both with nihilism and with
metaphysical universalism.  Universalism claims that for every set of
things, there is something else made up of those things; this thesis
is intuitively more plausible than nihilism.  But if we assume that
universalism is true, and if we do not presuppose four-dimensionalism,
we have to choose between two unintuitive versions of universalism:
one that posits a plurality of co-located (entirely overlapping)
objects, or one that denies that things can change their parts.
