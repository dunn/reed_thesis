Here's a conclusion, demonstrating the use of all that manual
incrementing and table of contents adding that has to happen if you
use the starred form of the chapter command.  The deal is, the chapter
command in \LaTeX\ does a lot of things: it increments the chapter
counter, it resets the section counter to zero, it puts the name of
the chapter into the table of contents and the running headers, and
probably some other stuff.

So, if you remove all that stuff because you don't like it to say
``Chapter 4: Conclusion'', then you have to manually add all the
things \LaTeX\ would normally do for you.  Maybe someday we'll write a
new chapter macro that doesn't add ``Chapter X'' to the beginning of
every chapter title.

\section{More info}
And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter
title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents
are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph.  Since
that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting
doesn't add an indent there.


%If you feel it necessary to include an appendix, it goes here.
%    \appendix
%      \chapter{The First Appendix}
%      \chapter{The Second Appendix, for Fun}


%This is where endnotes are supposed to go, if you have them.

  \backmatter % backmatter makes the index and bibliography appear
              % properly in the t.o.c...

% Make my bibliography be called "Bibliography" and not "References" (or "Works Cited" or...):
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{Works Cited}
    \bibliographystyle{ChicagoReedweb} % there are a variety of styles available; 
% replace ``plainnat'' with the style of choice.  You can refer to files in the bsts or APA 
% subfolder, e.g.  
% \bibliographystyle{APA/apa-good}  % or
% \bibliographystyle{bsts/mla-good} 

% if you're using bibtex, the next line forces every entry in the bibtex file to be included
% in your bibliography, regardless of whether or not you've cited it in the thesis.
    %\nocite{*}
    \bibliography{everything}

\end{spacing}
% Finally, an index would go here\,\ldots\,but it is also optional.
