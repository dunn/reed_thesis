\chapter*{Abstract}
Theories of metaphysical nihilism claim that there are no (or nearly
no) objects with parts.  Such theories claim that there are no chairs,
houses, mountains; some versions claim that there are no people.  The
philosophers who make these claims have trouble explaining why we
nonetheless believe that there are chairs.  The only successful
explanation is compatible both with there not being chairs and with
there being many things, including chairs.  Metaphysical universalism
is that claim that for every set of things, there is something else
made up of those things; this thesis is intuitively more plausible
than nihilism.  But if we assume that universalism is true, we have to
choose between two different versions of universalism: one that posits
a plurality of co-located (entirely overlapping) objects, or one that
denies that things (including chairs) can change their parts over
time.
