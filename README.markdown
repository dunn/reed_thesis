# _The Metaphysics of Ordinary Things_

By Alexander Dunn; approved for the Divison in May 2012

## Abstract

Theories of metaphysical nihilism claim that there are no (or nearly
no) objects with parts: no chairs, houses, mountains, and perhaps even
no people.  The philosophers who make these claims have trouble
explaining why we nonetheless believe there are such things.  The only
successful explanation is compatible both with nihilism and with
metaphysical universalism.  Universalism claims that for every set of
things, there is something else made up of those things; this thesis
is intuitively more plausible than nihilism.  But if we assume that
universalism is true, and if we do not presuppose four-dimensionalism,
we have to choose between two unintuitive versions of universalism:
one that posits a plurality of co-located (entirely overlapping)
objects, or one that denies that things can change their parts.
