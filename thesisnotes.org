* The big picture
** big plans
*** <2012-02-11 Sat> outline
1. No philosophical argument can prove that "there are chairs" is
   false
   - it can only show that what makes "there are chairs" true is less
     than we thought
   - there is no refuge in Ontologese
2. Nihilists cannot explain why we believe that there are chairs; this
   gives us more reason to think that "there are chairs" is true
   - van Inwagen's failure shows that there is not one univocal answer
     to the SCQ; what is required for there to be a chair is different
     from what is required for there to be a person
   - Merricks shows us that talk of 'composition' can lead us astray
     - it may not be true that "there is a chair" and "there are
       simples arranged chairwise" _mean_ the same thing, but they
       have the same truth-conditions (cf. Sider's Nihilo)
     - Merricks' example backfires on him.  He attempts to motivate
       nihilism by showing that "I see a chair!" is not an argument
       for the conclusion that there are chairs.  His analogy is [I'm
       adapting] a dog and a tree within 3 meters of each other.
       Obviously there is nothing composed of them, he says, so
       someone saying "I see it!" should not do anything for us.
       Therefore the person saying "I see a chair" shouldn't either.
       But let's drop the talk of 'composing' and give the thing a
       name.  A 'dog-bush' is a tree and a dog within three meters of
       each other.  Now it is much less tempting to say that
       dog-bushes _don't exist_.  What would that mean?  That dogs
       never get within three meters of trees?  _Of course_ there are
       dog-bushes.
3. If we're trying to maintain that there are chairs, but also trying
   to develop a consistent theory, then universalism seems obviously
   true.  But Unger's nihilism and the sorites paradoxes threaten this
   happy conclusion.
   - Ordinary terms like 'chair' are currently imprecise.  Unger
     thinks they are therefore incoherent.
   - Some think we can simply make them precise.  But not only would
     this defeat the purpose of such terms, it simply seems impossible
     to give necessary and sufficient conditions for there being a
     chair _in terms of simples_ (cf. Welles).
*** analytic definitions
# <<analyticity>>
cf Austin on [[entailment]]

Many of the metaphysical arguments for nihilism seem to rely on
definitional biconditionals.  For example, van Inwagen claims that
chairs necessarily do not exist because there is no true proposition
of the form "y (a chair) is composed of the xs iff ---------".  Unger,
meanwhile, thinks that ordinary terms are "incoherent" and "have no
application" because there are no necessary and sufficient conditions
for being a chair.  He brings this out with a sorites paradox: if we
take an ordinary chair and remove an insignificant amount of matter,
it is still a chair.  But if we keep removing matter, eventually there
will not be a chair.  Nothing in the meaning of 'chair' tells us at
what point the chair ceases to exist.  Unger's conclusion is that
either there is always a chair, or there never was.  He concludes
this, I think, because he assumes that if 'chair' is to be a coherent
term with 'application', then it must be possible to give an analysis
of 'chair' that supplies us with the necessary and sufficient
conditions of the term's application.  The model seems to be something
like this: if a term is meaningful, then we can 'deduce' the
conditions of its application.  Having done this, we can go out into
the world and see what the term applies to.  Unger, following this
model, attempts to analyse 'chair' (or 'stone') and so deduce the
conditions of its application.  He cannot deduce any necessary and
sufficient conditions, and so cannot find anything to apply the term
to.  He concludes that the term, having no application, is incoherent.

But this seems to be going about things in the wrong way.  Why assume
that this model is correct?  Troy got me thinking about this a few
weeks ago, and when I was re-reading Austin's _Sense and Sensibilia_,
I was struck by this passage (part of Austin's rejection of
'sense-data' theories according to which propositions like "That's a
pig" entail certain other propositions in the 'sense-datum' language):

> We learn the word 'pig', as we learn the vast majority of words for
  ordinary things, ostensively---by being told, in the presence of the
  animal, '_That_ is a pig'; and thus, though certainly we learn what
  kind of thing it is to which the word 'pig' can and can't be
  properly applied, we don't go through any kind of intermediate stage
  of relating the word 'pig' to a lot of _statements_ about the way
  things look, or sound, or smell.  The word is just not introduced
  into our vocabulary in this way.  Thus, though of course we come to
  have certain expectations as to what will and won't be the case when
  a pig is in the offing, it is wholly artificial to represent these
  expectations in the guise of _statements entailed by_ 'That is a
  pig'. (121)

Most words for 'ordinary things' are like this---we don't learn an
'analytic' definition, then go about the world looking for things that
fit the definition.  Rather, we learn words like 'chair' by asking
"what's that?" and being told "that's a chair".  Unger's claim that
'chair' and similar terms for ordinary things "have no application"
because he assumes there ought to be an 'analytic definition' of such
things; something like "x is a chair iff such-and-such".  On any
criteria like this, if it is true that something (some x) is a chair,
then certain "statements" are entailed by the truth of "x is a
chair"---namely, those statements on the right side of the
biconditional.  But Austin's point is that terms like 'pig' (and
'chair') do _not_ have these sorts of entailments.  There is _no_ true
biconditional of the form "x is a pig (chair, etc.) iff p".

As in the case of pigs above, we learn the meaning of 'chair' not by
receiving a set of necessary and sufficient conditions of application,
but by being _shown_ what things the term 'chair' is applied to.
"_That's_ a chair."  This is a perfectly familiar way of learning how
to use a word, and a word that is introduced this way is perfectly
meaningful.  Unger and van Inwagen illegitimately suppose that a term
must be amenable to the sort of analytic definition that goes "x is a
chair iff --------".  But in fact few ordinary things have such
definitions: it does not follow that they do not exist nonetheless.
Unger's argument that our ordinary terms have no application is
successful only if he is correct in assuming that such terms must have
"analytic definitions" of the biconditional form.  But what motivates
this assumption?
*** Vague objects and language
see [[levels][Levels of organization]]
**** Where does Unger get off?
***** intro
1. Unger claims that there are no chairs.

2. Why does he make this fantastic pronouncement?  Well, he has
   _arguments_ (I suppose the rest of us just huff and blow).

3. His arguments consist of variations on the sorites paradox and the
   problem of the many (of course, _he_ doesn't think the situations
   he presents are paradoxical or problematic).

4. The sorites cases involve an 'ordinary thing' (a rock, say, or a
   chair) which is progressively reduced or enlarged.  Since a rock
   does not cease to exist when a minuscule amount of matter is
   removed, we seem forced to conclude that there is still a rock
   after the last bit of rock is taken away.  Since a chair does not
   cease to be a chair when a tad more varnish is applied, we seem
   forced to conclude that a tower of varnish 100ft high with a chair
   at the bottom is (all of it) a chair.

5. The problems of the many involve similar scenarios.  If we suppose
   a chair to contain some set of molecules, then there is another set
   _almost exactly_ like the first set.  Do the members of this second
   set not compose a chair?  Why not?  What about the first set makes
   it so much more chair-like?  We seem forced to conclude that if the
   members of the first set compose a chair, so do the members of the
   second set---there are _two_ chairs, not one.  But what about
   _this_ set?  Similar arguments can be run for the _boundaries_ of
   the chair.

***** tolerance
1. The paradoxes highlighted by Unger rely on what Wright calls the
   'tolerance' of the terms in question.

2. A term is tolerance if, given that it applies to a certain
   situation, it would also apply to a situation minutely (or
   indiscriminably) different from the first situation.

3. If the thing in front of us can be properly called a stone, then
   that thing minus one atom can be properly called a stone.

4. Wright sees the paradox arising due to the conjunction of two
   theses about language (the _governing view_):
   - Language, like a game, is played by rules---for a given term,
     there are criteria for its correct application;
   - We can discover these rules by analyzing our language internally,
     as introspective masters of it.

5. The criteria mentioned in the first thesis above need not be
   _explanatory_.  (See [[explanatory]].)  What is necessary is that they
   be _regular_ (though it may be that those terms that fail to be
   applicable in a regular way are also those that cannot be defined
   in an explanatory way): 
   
   >> We suppose our use of language to be fundamentally _regular_; we
   picture the learning of language as the acquisition [or] grasp of a
   set of rules for the combination and application of expressions
   (326).

   So, if terms like 'chair' apply to anything at all, they do so in a
   consistent, regular way.  The problem is that this assumption of
   regularity, when paired with the second thesis, yields semantic
   incoherence.

6. When we examine a vague term like 'red' (Wright's example), we find
   that it is _defined ostensively_.  One learns what red is by being
   shown red things.  The criteria for applying the term to things is
   therefore _observational_: if something looks red (to me), I am
   justified in saying that it is red.  But being a mortal with mortal
   eyes, I cannot distinguish very minute differences of shade, e.g.,
   between two different reds.  On a series of color patches that
   range from red to orange, I may not be able to distinguish between
   any two adjacent patches.  I am therefore unable to identify any
   point at which 'red' ceases to apply to the patches.

7. Because we are supposing that we can discover the
   application-criteria of 'red' through this sort of introspection,
   we must conclude that there _is_ no point at which 'red' ceases to
   apply.  If it applies to the first patch (which it clearly does),
   then (because we are supposing that application-criteria are
   regular and consistent) it applies to the next patch, because the
   next patch is indistinguishable.  If it applies to _that_ patch,
   then...

8. it applies to the last patch.  But we stipulated that the last
   patch is _not_ red; it is orange.  Now we seem stuck with the
   conclusion that the last patch both is and is not red.  This is why
   'red' is taken to be incoherent by the governing view.

9. Parallel reasoning applies to the case of 'chair'.  The term is
   defined largely (if not wholly) ostensively; we learn what chairs
   are by being shown chairs.  What is and is not a chair therefore
   depends (at least in part) on observational criteria.  If, let us
   suppose, there is a chair before us, then such an object minus a
   minute bit of matter would still be (correctly referred to as) a
   chair.  If _that_ thing is a chair...

***** ways out
1. How do we avoid this conclusion?  Apparently, one or both of the
   theses of the governing view are false.  Either certain terms do
   not have regular application-criteria, or their rules are not
   discovered in the way described.

2. Unger, of course, disagrees.  He claims not to see anything
   paradoxical about the situation at all.  "There just aren't any
   chairs, then!"  But is he willing also to say that there aren't any
   red things?

3. One reason why we should consider this a paradoxical (or at least
   problematic) situation is that we display _competence_ with these
   apparently incoherent terms.  See [[competence]], and the [[wright6][conclusion]] of
   Wright.

4. Of course, Unger disagrees.  He seems to claim that we use terms
   like 'chair' more or less at _random_.  If there was any sort of
   pattern to our use, then Unger would have to admit that there are
   correct and incorrect ways to use 'chair'; he does not admit this.

5. But let us suppose that we _do_ use the term 'chair' (and other
   problematic terms) both correctly and incorrectly.  We now must
   decide what it is that makes a given use correct or incorrect.

6. One apparent solution is to reject the second thesis in favor of
   something like this:  "We cannot discover the semantics of these
   terms simply by introspective analysis, because they are more
   fine-grained than we can tell.  'Red', for instance _does_ have a
   precise point at which it ceases to apply to the color-series."
   This is more or less the epistemicist view.

7. Epistemicism has a number of problems.  Unger thinks it's absurd,
   and I'm not sure if I disagree.

8. Wright suggests a modification of the second thesis that seems to
   go in the other direction.  He mentions a "more behavioristic"
   account of the semantics of vague terms.  I'm not sure quite what
   this comes to.  "x is red iff someone (the community?) is disposed
   to call it red"?  A criterion like this seems to jettison semantic
   rules entirely.  (Is the Goldstein paper relevant here?)

9. Or one could attempt to evade the paradoxes by revising or
   eliminating the notion of semantic rules.

***** a brutal 'solution'
1. One might adapt the theory of brutal composition from Markosian.
   On that approach to mereology, there is no (obvious) regularity as
   regards what is and is not a composite object.  Some things compose
   chairs, others don't, and that's the end of it.  Analogously, some
   situations fulfill the application-criteria for 'chair', and others
   don't.  There is no regularity between cases.

2. This might work for ordinary object terms, but it less appropriate
   for color terms.  As Wright points out, we may in fact apply color
   terms inconsistently, but what 'ontological import' does this have?
   If "'x is red' is true iff x is red" is true, then if we allow any
   inconsistency in our (correct) application of "x is red", then we
   may end up committed to some color being red which is closer on the
   color-spectrum to orange than some color which is not red but
   orange.  This doesn't make much sense.

***** semantic localism?
see [[rayo]].
**** Vague boundaries
We want to avoid the conclusion that a table has some precise
boundary.  If we're aiming for this, then it's silly to say that,
strictly speaking, there is no boundary.  Our project starts from the
premise that the problem of vagueness will not convince us to say that
(strictly speaking) there is no chair.  So why should the problem of
vagueness convince us that (strictly speaking) there is no boundary?

[[file:unger.tex][unger.tex]]: define 'compose' in its technical sense

universalism is false _because_ I can't recognize billions of
different desks in front of me?

- If I could, would there be more desks?

- NO! We would just be able to talk about the desk in more precise
  terms.

- For example, before we knew about organs and shit, we talked only
  about the people. Then organ harvests became popular and we learned
  to talk about the person _in terms of_ their organs. Then biology
  and chemistry and physics came along and we figured out how to talk
  about people in terms of cells and molecules and atomic structure.

- These advances did not inaugurate ontological proliferation. We just
  began to _see more_ and so invented terms to describe what we were
  seeing.

- SO I NEED TO KNOW WHY plural-singular identity is uninteresting


to say that something is 'arranged chair-wise' is to _imply_ that it
doesn't deserve the term; compare Grice's example of the singer's
string of sounds closely resembling ---------. So when people refer to
something _as a chair_, they definitely can't be taken to mean that it
isn't _really_.

And there can't be necessary and sufficient conditions for ordinary
things (and least in van Inwagian).

**** Unger on Merricks
- is 'chairwise' incoherent?  not if we're relying on the problem of
  the many; it is not obviously part of the meaning of 'chairwise
  arrangement' that there is only one such arrangement in a particular
  location
- but the vagueness argument works.  but merricks has some replies
  - the sorites argument can be used to kill anything! who cares?
  - ok, I'll make 'chairwise arrangement' precise.  it means anything
    within this range of dimension and number of simples
    - now _if_ he holds that our belief that there is a chair is
      justified only if there is a chairwise arrangement, then he's
      going to miss cases
    - if he made his definition too broad, then it would be false that
      chairwise arrangements cause beliefs that there are chairs
**** intro
- reasons that I am aware of as my reasons
- *causes*
- that justify (but are 'external')

what kind of reason are we looking for when we ask "why do you believe
that is a chair you are sitting on?"

1. all philosophers ought to be able to broadly sketch a theory of why
   (causally) we believe what we do
2. philosophers who deny there are ordinary things ought to be able to
   explain why we believe that there are ordinary things

structure: metaphysical theory says that there are no chairs; but if
there are no chairs, then our beliefs that there are chairs are
inexplicable; thus we have (more) reason to doubt the metaphysical
theory

if there are chairs, then we have a simple causal story as to why we
believe there are chairs: there are chairs, and we see them

if there aren't chairs, then the causal story will be more complicated

**** Merricks on why we believe that there are chairs
Is there a quote where he says that things arranged chairwise interest
us (while dogbushes don't)?
**** Composition
1. If I introduce 'dogbush', what does it mean to say that the dogbush
   _is_ the tree and the dog?
2. Conventionalism; would Markosian think that there are dogbushes if
   the term gained currency?
3. Teams; are the members of the team parts of the team?  Do they
   compose the team?  Is the team therefore a _thing_?
4. Groups; for every set of people is there a group of them?  Is is
   only the salient groups that we take to exist?
5. Technical definions; van Inwagen's composition uses the
   'un-analysed' notion of parthood.  (see his [[v-intro][introduction]])
   - Am I using 'composition' and 'part' in the same sense as van
     Inwagen, Merricks, Markosian etc.?  If not, are their senses of
     the notions useful or not?

    if one asks "But _what is_ the Supreme Court?" we can just say "a
    group of people (with such-and-such authority)".  If they then ask
    "_which_ group?" we just say "well, _now_ it's x but it used to be

  - Sandra Day O'Connor _was_ a member of the Supreme Court.  Does
    this mean that her 1981--2006 part _is_ a member of the Supreme
    Court, or that _she_ was, but is no longer (at all)?  The latter
    sounds right.  But how does this square with the composition
    operator?  If the operator takes _things_ and produces a group,
    then it can't do it all in one fell swoop unless things have
    temporal parts.  If Sandra Day O'Connor does not have temporal
    parts, then the group operator can't take _her_, because she isn't
    always part of the Supreme Court.  So if we don't want to
    presuppose temporal parts, the group operator has to be
    _dynamic_.  It can't just take things, compose them and be
    done---it has to _add and remove things over time_.  (cf. Thomson
    on time-relativized fusions.)
- [X] can't we account for the difference of sets and groups-at-times
  by appeal to their MODAL PROPERTIES?
  - indeed yes, but then we have to specify different _ontological
    categories_ for every single thing that has a unique modal
    profile.  The modal properties of a statue, moreover, are
    determined by _convention_.
  - this allows us to avoid the 'modal explosion of reality' that
    Bennett identifies.
  - but isn't Fine's whole theory of part supposed to motivate such an
    explosion?
  - one reason to stick with our conventionalist theory would be to
    'contain' the explosion.
  - we have two options: embrace the explosion or go conventionalist.
    Fine's theory offers us the explosive solution, but we will have
    to accept that each different composition operator corresponds to
    a different _kind_ of thing, with different modal properties,
    persistence conditions, etc.  So the Supreme Court and the Special
    Committee will not both be groups; they will be different _kinds_
    of things, things which both happen to be referred to as
    'groups'.  The conventionalist route allows us to avoid this: the
    Court and the Committee are both _sets_, and the statue and lump
    are both _things_.
#  - and even _with_ the explosion, the 'C = S' problem will _still_
#    arise.  Just like there could be two things that exist for the
#    same time, couldn't there also be two things that have the same
#    modal (and other?) properties _but differ in how long they last_,
#    or _don't differ at all_ (identity of indiscernibles)?

    claim that this conceptual link does not entail the existence of
    chairs.  This claim relies on the further claim that (c) the
    meaning of `chair' does not make it (conceptually) true that there
    are chairs.  (Does Merricks think that it is conceptually true
    that there are things arranged chairwise?)
  - but because the meaning of `chair' is determined ostensively, it
     _is_ conceptually true that there are chairs.
  1. merricks' explanation
    - 'nearly as good as true'
    - made possible by the conceptual connection between 'chair' and
      'chairwise'
  2. conceptual connections and definitions
    - 'chairwise' is defined such that 'there are things arranged
      chairwise' is not synonymous with 'there are chairs'
    - but that doesn't rule out their being co-extensive
    - what makes 'there are things arranged chairwise' true?
      - the existence of things (atoms) arranged in the shape of a
        chair
    - what makes 'there are chairs' true?
      - Merricks claims that it requires something more than does
        'there are things arranged chairwise'
      - namely, it being the case that there is some _thing_ composed
        of the things arranged chairwise
    - meaning and truth-conditions
      - the claim that 'there are chairs' just means 'there are things
        arranged chairwise'
      - they don't mean the same thing, but that doesn't prevent them
        from being co-extensive
      - the meaning of 'there are chairs' is presumably a product of
        the meanings of the constituents.  so...
    - what does 'chair' mean?
      - no necessary and sufficient non-circular definition
      - meaning determined largely by ostension
      - 'there are chairs' means 'there are those sorts of things'?

*** The Quest for Reality
<<quest>>
**** Chapter 1
16: "The philosophical quest must start somewhere. It needs a set of
beliefs about what the world is like. Without some attitudes,
perceptions, beliefs, or theories to start with, it would have nothing
to reflect on."
**** Chapter 2: The Philosophical Conception of an Independent Reality
24: "We believe that there are mountains on earth, that there are fish
in the sea, that human beings believe that there are mountains on
earth and fish in the sea, that human beings have many different
experiences, and so on. And for virtually everything we believe, we
see that its truth or falsity is independent of our believing it. In
that sense, we have a rich, determinate conception of an independent
reality: a specific view of the world that is there _anyway_."

26: "if our conception of the world is _everything_ we believe, we
could not arrive at the conclusion that some of our beliefs do not
represent or correspond to that reality as we conceive of it...our
conception of reality, if it includes everything we believe, will be a
conception of a world in which those things are true. That is what
reality will be like for us."

27: "We therefore need a conception expressed in terms of only some,
but not necessarily all, of our current beliefs. Those to which
reality does not correspond are to be eliminated. But it must contain
_some_ of our beliefs, since to have a conception of the world's being
a certain way is to have certain beliefs about it."

Once we begin asking the philosophical question about how the world
really is, why should we expect _any_ of our beliefs to be true of it?

27: "If we can arrive at the philosophical conception of reality at
all, then, it will have to be by starting out with all our beliefs
about everything and somehow carving out of that immense totality a
conception which, after philosophical scrutiny, will have been reduced
to only a portion of the original total."

> "We cannot have a conception of the world that is somehow completely
separate from the way we take things to be."

Quite right. If we demand to compare the world we live in with the
world-as-it-really-is, there is nothing that carries over from the
first to the second.

28: "It is perhaps not surprising that a metaphysical enquiry into the
relation between our beliefs and reality should require both
engagement and detachment from our beliefs about the world. The
question is whether we can take those opposing attitudes towards the
same set of beliefs. And there is the further question whether the
project requires that we do so at the same time."

30: "Whatever is due only to us and to our own ways of responding to
and interacting with the world does not reflect or correspond to
anything present in the world as it is independently of us. The aim of
an "absolute" conception, then, is to form a description of the way
the world is, not just independently of its being believed to be that
way, but independently, too, of all the ways in which it happens to
present itself to us human beings from our particular standpoint
within it. An "absolute" conception would be a conception from which
all such traces of ourselves have been removed. Nothing would remain
that would indicate whose conception it is, how those who form or
possess that conception experience the world, or when or where they
find themselves in it. It would be as impersonal, impartial, and
objective a picture of the world as we can achieve."

31: "we have or form some conception of that independent reality and
come to understand parts or aspects of our original conception of the
world as not representing it as it is. If we see them as products or
reflections of something peculiar to human experience or to the human
perspective on the universe, we assign them a merely "subjective" or
dependent status and eliminate them from our conception of the world
as it is independently of us."

32: "This is more than the claim that in moving from a naive and
unreflective to a sophisticated and more carefully considered set of
beliefs about the world we should try to eliminate partiality, special
interest, or even general human peculiarity as possible sources of
ignorance or error. Smart says we should eliminate certain _concepts_
from our considered conception of the world."

> but "we humans are perhaps the only beings who have any concepts at
all, so all concepts are peculiarly or uniquely ours. That would mean
that all concepts should be eliminated from the description we give of
the world, and that would leave us with no concepts and no beliefs and
no conception of a world at all." (33)

34: Smart's "cosmic language" (problematic)

35: "But if we do grant that such beings [without a conception of
shape or number] are even as much as possible, surely we do not commit
ourselves to the conclusion that all concepts of shape [or number]
must be eliminated from any conception of the way things are
independently of us...I think the most we would conclude about beings
who differ from human beings in those numerical or mathematical ways
is that they are simply not equipped to find out certain things that
are independently true of the world. Those who cannot count could not
find out how many chairs there are in a certain room, for example."

"Many highly competent actual, and not merely possible, investigators
of the world lacked much of the mathematical knowledge we now
possess. We should no conclude that at most only what we share with
them is part of reality as it is independently of us."

Stroud seems to assume here that some of what we know is
independent. But why should what we share with them be part of
independent reality? Why any of it?

36: "But why should we not conclude in each case that these possible
"investigators" would simply be missing something that is there? Our
being able to conceive of such beings does not in itself give us
reason to exclude concepts of smell, colour, or shape from an
"absolute" conception of how things are, any more than the possibility
of innumerate or mathematically impoverished "investigators" gives us
reason to exclude mathematical concepts."

If that doesn't, then what on earth would?

> "I think our conception of what the world is really like---how we
believe the world to be---is what determines in each case whether
conceiving of other possible beings is taken to reveal a special human
"peculiarity" or only to show that those other beings would be missing
something that is independently there."

What is Stroud's position on this page? Some sort of 'conceptual
conservatism'; our having a concept in our picture of the world gives
us at least _prima facie_ justification in supposing that it is
absolutely real.

37: "There would have been trees and mountains and fish, just as we
now think of them, whether or not human beings existed or had
different interests and aims. The concepts we have of such things are
true of them independently of human interests and aims. Because our
possession of concepts reflects our interests and aims in this way,
there are probably a great many things in the world for which we do
not have concepts, or at least very determinate concepts, since we
lack the relevantly specific interests in those aspects of the
world. I hope I will be excused from giving examples."

There would then be _infinitely many_ objects in the world that we are
_totally_ ignorant of. It would be _impossible_ to know what all there
is in the world. (Thus universalism)

37--38: "If human beings and their thoughts and experiences are to be
accorded a place in an independent world at all, the concepts we use
to think about them must be acceptable for use in even our most
reflective conception of the world."

There needs to be an _argument_ for _why_ human beings ought to
be accorded a place in an independent world! It takes a lot of nerve
to _assume_ that we have some deep correspondence with reality.

38: "If we are careful in applying the concepts we have, even those
that apply to human beings and their interests in and perspective on
the world, are they not adequate to describe "absolutely" without
distortion both those parts of the world that are dependent on human
beings and their experiences and those parts that are not?"

39: "two conceptions of the world might differ because of the
different characteristics of those who hold them. If the second
conception is included in the first but is more restricted, the most
plausible conclusion for both groups to draw would be that the more
restricted believers are simply missing part of what is there...If the
two conceptions are different and do not overlap, it would be equally
plausible for each group to conclude that, because of its own
'peculiarities', it is finding out about a different part, or
different aspects, of the world from the other group."

There are always more concepts that a group or person could apply to
their experiences. If someone else told us about double-books, must we
then admit that we are failing to recognize things in the world?

40: "Just as we can think that investigators with limited capacities
might miss part of what others with greater capacities know about the
world, so we can acknowledge the possibility that our own conception
of the world does not capture everything. Those with greater
capacities might know more and understand more. We can even think that
perhaps we believe more than is actually true of the world."

1. First, there is no upper bound to what they can 'know'

2. Second, this isn't a quantitative thing. Those with greater
capacities may well know _other_ things and understand the world
_differently_. Again, we are not the measure of the world, and it's
not at all obvious that our conceptual framework is somehow on the
golden-brick road leading toward total knowledge of reality.


40--41: "It is _how_ we think of the world that is said to be stained
with our own human "peculiarities", but we have found no general test
for exposing the presence of such "relativity" in a conception of the
world that shows no evident signs of it."

(33--35): "is it possible that other intelligences could exist
without some concept or other peculiarity?"

**** Chapter 3
45: "I want to start with a minimal conception of the world that seems
as "absolute" as any human conception could be..."

49 re physicalism: "To deny that what we think or say really does
imply the existence of such things [numbers, places, hopes] would
require some way of telling what kinds of things are said to exist by
a certain thought or stretch of discourse, and what are not. In
addition to such a criterion of 'ontological commitment', we would
need a convincing demonstration that objects that occupy space are the
only objects said or implied to exist by everything we hold to be
true."

50--53: what's a physical object? what's a physical fact? what's a
physical vocabulary? what's a physical science? (cf. Schaffer "Is
there a fundamental level?")

53: "Since physics can change its scope and vocabulary and still
remain physics, the idea of what is 'physical' cannot simply be the
idea of whatever is included in physical science as we currently think
of its limits. The idea of the physical must be to some extent
independent of the specific content of the sciences we give that name
to at any particular time."

54--55: "If being expressed in the language of physics were a
condition of a statement's being part of a description of the
independent world, it would not be part of the independent world that
there are such things as mountains on earth or fish in the
sea. 'Mountain', 'earth', 'fish', and 'sea' are not terms of
physics. On that criterion, it would not even be part of the physical
world that there is a planet earth or that it is 93 million miles from
the sun. 'Planet' and 'sun' are not terms of physics
either. Obviously, we must think of the admissible vocabulary as
extending beyond physics proper to include the physical sciences
understood in some more general way."

56--57: demonstratives and statements of fact

62: the economic world

63: "A world, as we have seen, is made up of facts, not objects."

_Our_ world, at least.

64: "I have been conceding that we can pick out a set of statements in
purely physical terms and separate them from all the other things we
unreflectively believe. But that alone cannot establish the
exclusiveness of 'the physical world' as we have been understanding
it, or put it in any special position. We can also pick out sets of
statements in purely economic terms, or in psychological terms, or in
terms which ascribe colours to things. But that does not establish the
exclusiveness of those 'worlds'. It does not support the conclusion
that statements we accept which are expressed in other terms are not
true."

65: "All true statements could be said to describe or to state what is
so in _the same_ world in the sense that the world is everything that
is so, and each of those statements says something that is so. Each of
them gives part of the world in that sense."
**** Chapter 4

71: "the 'all or nothing' dilemma": reality cannot be simply what we
believe to be the case, for them the question 'what is there?' would
not even arise. But if we try to withhold all beliefs, there is no
possibility of answering the question. One middle way is the
physicalist thesis.

74: the "'explanatory' criterion of the limits of 'reality"'

75: "we do not in fact believe in Descartes's demon. His machinations
do not best explain my or anyone else's responses because no such
demon exists. What we can appeal to in order to explain our beliefs
and responses, and so what is to be regarded as part of the world,
must be something we believe in. It must be part of our conception of
the world. It is what we think _does_ explain our responses that is to
be reckoned as part of reality, not just whatever _would_ explain
them if it were so."

75--76: 'unmasking' explanations

ghosts: we learn to _not_ see them

78: "Of course, we all know that human beings perceive colours,
perceive that things are coloured, come to believe that things are
coloured, and so on."

whereas we do not all know that humans see ghosts

"I am assuming that full semantic reduction of the one [psychological
facts] to the other [physical facts] is not available."

81: "With a rich body of psychological facts on the scene, it is a
real question whether satisfactorily austere explanations of them will
be available."

but is it _possible_ that it might be done?

83: "The sentence in purely physical terms, 'Processes P1, P2,
P3,...are occurring', does not imply the sentence 'Smith is buying a
house from Jones'. Nor does the second imply the first."

_Of course not_. Because the second sentence involves semantic
conventions and vagueness that prevent its correspondence with any
statements of scientific precision.

If we could build a (near-)perfect model of Earth that contained
(miniature) versions of everything on our planet, how would we do it?
By coding physical laws into it. When the little humans start running
around painting pictures and talking about the marvellous colours they
have, we'll probably say to each other, "look! they _do_ see colors!
it worked!" (psychological predicates will be perfectly appropriate.)

84: "the physical sciences cannot explain everything."

85: "We could perhaps even concede that the physical explanation
explains why the truth stated by 'There occurred physical event P,
which is in fact the same event as Jones' seeing something yellow' is
true. But that would not mean that the physical facts explain why that
psychological event occurred."

88: "neither idealism nor mind-body dualism is essential to finding
mysterious the production of mental effects by nothing more than
events described and explained in the physical sciences."

89: "A full account of what goes on physically in a certain area
during a certain period of time, along with knowledge of physical laws
which those events instantiate, would enable us to explain why, given
the earlier events, the later events occur. If we restrict ourselves
to that physical story alone, we will not know whether anything
psychological occurred during that period at all."

No? If we had a model Earth we could _look and see._

90: "Take the broadly psychological phenomenon of one person's buying
a house from another. It seems absurd to look in the vocabulary of the
physical sciences for a minute description of the correlate or
antecedent of such a type of action\ ...\ Buying a house and believing
that there is a yellow lemon there are complex psychological phenomena
that can be manifested in many different physical ways."

91: "Suppose we did discover significant correlations between certain
physical conditions and certain kinds of sensations or
perceptions. Part of what I think Locke was responding to in his
invocation of "the arbitrary will and good pleasure of the Wise
Architect" is that, even so, there would be a way in which the
psychological phenomena in question would remain forever unexplained."

But on model Earth, it doesn't really _matter_. They happen, all due
to physical laws.

93: "on this view of perceptions as mental effects of interaction with
an otherwise physical world, that would be true of all our
perceptions. They would all be nothing but end products of certain
physical processes. So our perceptions of shape, size, motion, and so
on---all those features that are mentioned in the physical sciences
and so are thought really to belong to objects in the physical
world---would also be explained as arising when they do only by
discovering the conditions in which they, in fact, arise."

96: "The limits of that privileged core of facts that will constitute
reality cannot be defined or identified in advance. Where the limits
lie depends on what turns out to be needed to explain everything that
must be explained."

97: "You cannot hope to explain something unless you grant that there
is such a thing and you have at least some idea of what it is."

or to explain it away?

102: "it is also possible, if rare, for someone to be said truly to
see a yellow lemon when there is, in fact, no yellow lemon near the
person to be seen. A hallucination or a hologram can provide just such
an experience. That can happen even if the person knows what is going
on and does not believe that there is a yellow lemon where he sees
one. It remains true that the person sees a lemon (not a banana) , and
he sees it to be yellow (not green)."

103: "The relations among propositional seeing, predicational seeing,
and seeing an instance of some property are obviously complex...it
would be courting trouble to speak without qualification of 'a
perception of yellow' or 'an experience of yellow' or even 'an
experience of seeing something yellow', as if there were only one kind
of thing it could be."

103--104: facts that need explaining

105: "We understand what we perceive to be related in some way to what
we can think about, believe, know, want, hope, fear, and so on. And
what we can believe, know, want, and so on is, in general, what can be
so in the world...There must be some intelligible relation between
what we perceive and what we think or believe."

106: "Descartes admitted that we do call physical objects coloured,
but he thought that in doing so we are simply confused. We have not
freed ourselves from certain 'prejudices of youth' that continue to
bedevil the mind. Unfortunately, he never explained exactly what our
confusion is, or how it is even possible for us to make it."

compare Unger on nihilism

112: "We might always simultaneously see one small, square, yellow
thing and another large ovoid green thing 'together' in the same
experience. We see instances of the properties of being yellow and
being ovoid, and we see them together, but we do not see one thing to
be both yellow and ovoid."

113: "If it made no sense to attribute to an object the very feature
we see when we see colour, just as it makes no sense to attribute to
an object the very feature we feel when we feel pain, because in each
case we are just having a certain characteristic 'sensation', so it
would make no sense to attribute to an object the very feature we see
when we see shape, or size, or motion, or any other perceivable
property."

115: "the shapes we perceive things to have are shapes we _can_ also
think or believe objects to have."

intentionality of shape [and color] perception

116: "If intelligible thoughts about the colours of objects are
sometimes true, objects are coloured."

**** Chapter 6

120--: the 'dispositional' account of color

A painful instrument does not have pain 'inhering' in it; to say _it_
is painful is to say that it is disposed to give us pain under
appropriate circumstances. Likewise, the argument goes, a yellow lemon
does not have yellow inherent in it, but is disposed to produce in us
sensations of yellow (in appropriate circumstances).

121: "$x$ is yellow iff normal human perceivers standing in certain
relations $R$ to $x$ in certain kinds of perceptual circumstances $C$
would get perceptions of yellow."

125: "When filled in with the appropriate specifications, the
biconditional about yellow things probably is, in fact, true." (but
that doesn't mean that colour is subjective; it is not _necessarily_
true.)

125: "the goal is to preserve a rich world of independent fact in
which the colours of things, but not all the properties of things, are
shown to depend on the effects those things would produce in human
subjects...The question is whether and how this view of colour can be
defended without holding that everything else is subjective as well."

133: "Our understanding of the colours of objects tolerates the
possibility of an object's being a certain colour even though it would
not produce perceptions of that colour in human perceivers if the
world were different in certain ways."

- does this beg the question somehow?

- "That [claim above] seems undeniable when the colour perceptions in
  question are identified independently of specifying the color [sic]
  of any physical object."

- But this seems legitimate because we have seen no viable alternative
  (colors defined in terms of perceptions).


137: "It makes no sense to suppose that a thumbscrew remains a painful
instrument even if it would never cause pain to anyone to whom it is
applied."

but the parallel with color does not hold:

138: "What I think we must deny is that ripe lemons would simply _have
to_ have been a different colour if human perceptual mechanisms, or
the laws of nature affecting the human perception of ripe lemons, had
been different in certain ways. The possibility I am specifying is the
possibility of ripe lemons that are _yellow_, or simply _yellow
objects_, not being disposed to produce perceptions of yellow in
normal human perceivers under certain conditions."

141: "we can see objects to have dispositional properties. And just as
with the disposition to dissolve, I think that in looking at a lemon
we can see that it has a disposition to produce perceptions of
something yellow in suitably placed perceivers. The difficulty...is
not whether that is something we can perceive. The real question is
whether that dispositional property that we can see an object to have
is the same property that the dispositional theory identifies as the
object's being yellow." (no?)

**** Chapter 7

145: "What we believe to be so when we believe an object is yellow is
what we see to be so when we see it to be yellow."

"The unmasking project cannot deny that we perceive many different
colours or that we believe physical objects to be coloured." (cf van
Inwagen)

146: "In carrying out the [unmasking] project, we must therefore
understand human beings to believe many things about the colours of
objects without ourselves holding any beliefs about the colours of
things in that sense. That is how those beliefs are to be exposed as
false. And we must acknowledge that people have perceptions of colour,
and of objects' being coloured, without ourselves believing or
implying that any physical object has any colour...

"This raises the question whether we could find people to have such
beliefs and perceptions if we were barred from the outset from
believing that anything in the world is coloured."

147: "Thoughts of unicorns and dragons [and other nonexistent things]
are made up of thoughts of things that we believe do exist, like
horses, horns, wings, claws, and fire. Even if we accept the appeal to
"complexity" in cases like these, the same kind of story is not
plausible for the colours of things" because there are no 'simple'
colours that we could build up.

"The question for the metaphysical project is whether we can
acknowledge someone's perceiving a certain colour if we do not hold
that anything anywhere has any colour at all."

148: rainbows

149: "It is not easy to determine, with any assurance of completeness,
exactly what is and is not required for us to understand one another
in all the ways we do. But the unmasking project can succeed only if
in carrying it out we do not presuppose any of the things we claim to
unmask. We must admit perceptions and beliefs about the colours of
things in the world for there to be something for the unmasking
explanation to explain. But in acknowledging those psychological
facts, we must fulfill all the conditions of acknowledging them. And
if those conditions of acknowledgement and attribution include our
holding those beliefs about the colours of things, the conception of
the world that we would have to hold, even to admit all the
psychological facts that need to be explained, would be too rich to
enable us to find that the colours of things had been
unmasked. Eliminating the colours of things entirely from our
conception of the world, which is a condition of success of the
project, would leave us incapable of acknowledging the very facts that
the unmasking project is supposed to explain. If that were so, we
could never achieve by this explanatory route a conception of the
world in which there are perceptions and beliefs about the colours of
things but no coloured objects."

"The contents of all our perceptions and beliefs about the colours of
things make up such a large, pervasive, and irreducible portion of all
the things we take to be true of the world that they cannot be sliced
off that conception while leaving intact our understanding of
ourselves as perceiving and believing all the things we do."

If this is true for colour, then how can we slice away our beliefs in
_everything_?

150: "We believe that many people perceive and believe there are
yellow, ovoid lemons, large grey elephants, and countless other
physical things, for example, and we also believe such
nonpsychological facts as that there are yellow, ovoid lemons, large
grey elephants, and countless other physical things. The suspicion I
want to explore is that that is no accident. Perhaps we can have
beliefs of the one kind only because we have some beliefs of the other
kind."

150--151: "we who inhabit the world can understand someone in that
world as believing something or as perceiving something only if we can
somehow connect the possession of the psychological states we
attribute to the person with facts and events in the surrounding world
that we take the beliefs and perceptions to be about. We understand
one another to be parts of, and engaged in, a common world we all
share. If we ourselves had no beliefs at all about what is happening
in the environment or what another person is most likely to be paying
attention to, we would be in no position to attribute any beliefs or
perceptions to that person at all."

"We cannot make sense of someone as believing something we know to be
false unless we can identify what he believes and can offer some
explanation of how he comes to get it wrong."

"There is an attitude or state of a certain kind, one the one hand,
and the object or content of that state in the other."

152: "'Jones is thinking of a unicorn' states a different fact from
'Jones is thinking of a dragon' because unicorns are different from
dragons, even though there are no such things anywhere. If we did not
know what unicorns and dragons are, and that they are different, we
would not understand those sentences and so would not know what
psychological facts they state and that they are different facts."

153: "If we could not think of a yellow lemon, we could make no sense
of predicational perception of a yellow lemon, since we could make no
sense of what it is a perception of. We could not then intelligibly
ascribe such perceptions to others or to ourselves."

154: "Being incapable of predicational thought of a yellow lemon would
leave us incapable of seeing a yellow lemon, in the sense of seeing it
to be yellow. We might see a lemon that is yellow, but that is no
great achievement. Even a creature without colour vision can see a
lemon that is in fact yellow."

158: "If Jones utters the sentence "There is a yellow lemon on the
table" about the table right before us, what belief could we recognize
her to be expressing?" [if we are to take the unmasking seriously]

160: "it is because I understand what Jones says, and know what
perceptions of yellow are, that I attribute a perception of yellow to
her in those circumstances. And I know what perceptions of yellow are
because I know what yellow is. It is the colour of yellow objects. I
believe that many objects are yellow."

As unmaskers, we could "acknowledge no yellow objects in the
world. Nor could we identify perceptions of yellow as perceptions of
that property that people _believe_ to belong to objects that are
yellow. We would admit no objects that are yellow. It would get us no
further to say that perceptions of yellow are perceptions of that
property that people believe to belong to objects that they believe to
be yellow. That specification is not unique."

161: coloured things as public objects

163: "To attribute perceptions to others on the basis of what happens
in his own case, he must know what happens in his own case. He could
attribute to others perceptions with determinate contents only if he
knew what kinds of perceptions he himself gets from the kind of object
he sees them to be perceiving."

166--167: "Whatever property a would-be unmasker could understand
himself to have perceptions of when a yellow, elliptical patch appears
to him in the presence of a ripe lemon, it could not be the same
property that others _believe_ to belong to objects in believing them
to be yellow. The property that others believe to belong to objects in
the thought that they are yellow is the same property that those other
people also see when they have perceptions of yellow. They take
themselves to have veridical predicational perceptions of yellow
objects. So even a would-be unmasker's attribution to others of
perceptions of some property that he takes himself to perceive would
not be the attribution to others of perceptions of yellow. Since the
unmasker could not understand himself to have perceptions of yellow,
he could not attribute perceptions of yellow to others on the basis of
what he can recognize in his own case."

"if he could understand them as having any such beliefs at all, he
would have to acknowledge that the property they attribute to a
physical object in the _belief_ that it is yellow is a different
property from the property that he can understand them to _perceive_
in any perceptions he can attribute to them on the basis of their
similarity to the perceptions he understands himself to get in the
presence of a ripe lemon."

168: "someone who started out with no beliefs at all about the colours
of things would be unable even to find the relevant perceptions or
beliefs in the first place, so he would have nothing to unmask."

**** Chapter 8

176: "It is probably true that if we did not largely agree about the
colours of things we would have no firm or secure beliefs about the
colours of things at all. But the same is true of beliefs about the
shapes and sizes and motions of things, and of everything else we
believe. Without general agreement, we could not say or understand or
believe anything. But that does not mean that what we all believe when
we agree about something is only that we all agree. The point is not
that what we believe when we believe that an object is yellow or ovoid
is that a majority of our fellow human beings agree with us in our
belief. That would leave the belief with no determinate content. What
we all believe, or agree about, is that the object is yellow or
ovoid. But if we did not largely agree in the application of those
concepts and in many of the judgements we make with them, we would
have no such concepts and could make no such judgements at all."

179: "The [unmasking] theory says that no objects are coloured, so if
we simply acquiesced without comment in our familiar beliefs that
lemons are yellow, tomatoes are red, and so on, it would be as if we
had not really accepted the theory after all. We would be paying lip
service to it while still believing what it says we should not
believe. Of course, we might then try to purge ourselves of all
beliefs about the colours of things. That would not be easy to do, to
put it mildly, but if what I have argued is correct, it would require
that we also stop thinking of other people as having beliefs about the
colours of things as well. That would not be easy to do either...

"Even if we could somehow manage to repudiate all beliefs about the
colours of things, we still would be faced with the facts of
perception. We presumably could not deny that we see colours or even
that we see coloured objects, in the sense that we typically see the
objects around us to be coloured. That is what would make it so
difficult for us to give up our belief in coloured things. They stare
us in the face every time we open our eyes."

181: "When the obvious truth of what we perceive and believe to be so
is what makes us unable to believe otherwise, our inability is not
seen as a failing. On the contrary, it is a mark of our openness or
unproblematic access to the way the world is."

182: "Taking the error theory seriously in this way could lead us to
regard colour as nothing more than a quality or feature that is
inevitably present in our experience whenever we see physical objects,
much as a feeling of sadness can accompany one's perception of one's
long-unvisited childhood home."

187: standpoints of belief and regress

"if we hold any determinate beliefs at all, we must hold some beliefs
to which no such further specification of standpoint has to be added."

191: "I think the metaphysical quest for reality distorts and so leads
us away from our everyday conception of the world, and so away from an
accurate understanding of ourselves."

**** Chapter 9

193: "In trying to raise the question, we cannot rid ourselves of a
conception of the world as filled with coloured objects, so we can
never achieve the kind of detachment from our beliefs that the
metaphysical question seems to require."

"the impossibility of a successful unmasking project implies nothing
one way or the other about what the nonpsychological world is like
with respect to color."

196: "It is not easy to accept, or even to understand, this
philosophical theory [of transcendental idealism]. Accepting it
presumably means believing that the sun and the planets and the
mountains on earth and everything else that has been here so much
longer than we have are nonetheless in some way or other dependent on
the possibility of human thought and experience."

199: "without beliefs about the colours of things we could not
recognize the presence in the world of perceptions of and beliefs
about the colours of things, and that if we do think that people have
such perceptions and beliefs, we must believe that objects are
coloured."

203: "The outcome of a successful unmasking would be a view with two
parts: (1) people have many beliefs about the colours of things, and
(2) those beliefs are all false; things are not coloured. What we have
concluded about the conditions of belief attribution is that anyone
who finds the first conjunct to be true will believe that objects are
coloured, so he cannot consistently believe the second conjunct to be
true. So he cannot find any relevant beliefs to unmask as false."

205: "if we know that objects are coloured, we know it in the way we
know many other things---by observing the world around us and doing
the best we can to find out on that basis what is so. We do not know
that objects are coloured by deducing it from the fact that we all
believe that objects are coloured. We do not know it by having
established that the would-be unmasker's view is contradictory. But we
do know that objects are coloured. So we do know that the second
conjunct of the view the unmasker aspires to is false."

206: "If there are any beliefs that are indispensable to thought, as
Kant held that there are, they will still be invulnerable to
unmasking. None of them could be abandoned consistently with our
having a conception of an independent world. We must continue to think
of any world we can think about at all as being the way those
indispensable beliefs say it is."

208--209: dissatisfaction

209: "I think it is undeniable that we feel a strong urge to draw some
such ['objective'] conclusion if we are convinced of the failure of
the view that colours are unreal or subjective. The strength of that
urge is a measure of the strength of a metaphysical desire I think we
have to discover how we really stand to the independent world around
us. I have been trying to identify exactly what that desire amounts to
and what it would take to satisfy it. What, exactly, do we seek? I
think we are now in a position to see that if we do have such a desire
concerning the colours of objects, it is a desire we can never
satisfy. We cannot get into a position to ask the metaphysical
question about the reality of colour in the right way."

**** Chapter 10

211: "Any investigation of the relation between our conception of the
world and the world that conception purports to be about must start
with the idea of our having a determinate conception of the
world. This means that any philosophical investigator of that
conception must identify the beliefs in question and so must
acknowledge that the conditions of our having beliefs with just those
contents, and the conditions of his recognizing us as having them, are
fulfilled. The question is whether that can be done consistently with
finding that the beliefs represent nothing that is or could be so in
the independent world."

"Keeping one's understanding of the scrutinized beliefs free of any
prior conception of what is supposed to be available in reality gives
the metaphysical project a chance of revealing something about the
relation between those beliefs and reality, if it can be carried out."

216: "we can learn from the case of colours to pay special attention
to what it takes for anyone to acknowledge the presence in the world
of human beings' holding what he can recognize to be evaluative
beliefs. If he needs some evaluative beliefs of his own to do that, he
will never reach a conception of the world in which there is nothing
corresponding to the contents of any of the evaluative beliefs he
recognizes. No unmasking could succeed."

*** Engagement and Metaphysical Dissatisfaction
**** Chapter 1
5: "Could anyone who thinks and acts in the world as we all do
consistently understand his own and other people's beliefs about
causation, necessity, and values as nothing more than what a negative
metaphysical verdict about them says they are?"

"Metaphysical curiosity can express itself even about a conception of
the world that we think is as firmly based and well supported as any
conception of the world can be."

6: "One thing I think the logical positivists were right about was
their recognition that metaphysics is not just one among many
different ways of studying the world. It is a special and
distinctively _philosophical_ study of the way things are."

7: Kant's metaphysical project "has one feature that it seems to me
any metaphysical inquiry worth taking seriously must have. It is what
might be called metaphysics _from within_. It starts with the thoughts
and beliefs we actually have about the world and investigates the
conditions of our having them."

10: "to reach any satisfactory metaphysical outcome even in that case
[the case of beauty] we would need good answers to three
interconnected questions. The first question is how it is known or how
it is to be established that the metaphysical verdict is correct. What
shows that beauty is only in the eye of the beholder and is nothing
present on its own in the world as it is fully independently of all
beholders' responses? This question is often simply ignored. It can
seem obvious or beyond question that beauty itself could be nothing in
the independent world. But finding or declaring it obvious is just
another expression of the metaphysical conviction that the traditional
maxim about beauty simply must be right. It is not an independent
reason in support of that conclusion.

11: "Whether something is beautiful or not would depend on how human
beings do or would respond to it. It could then be said, with
admissible license, that the beauty they speak of lies only in the
eyes of the beholders. |12| \\ "But is this actually true of our
judgements of beauty? This is a question about what we actually say or
think or judge in speaking of the beauty of things. This is the second
of the three questions to be asked about this kind of metaphysical
enterprise. It is the question of what the thoughts or beliefs that
are subject to metaphysical assessment are really like, and how they
work."

14: "The third question to be asked is whether we can find that we
do in fact think of and respond to beauty in the ways the metaphysical
reflection depends on and at the same time accept what the
metaphysical verdict says: that there is no such thing as beauty in
the world independently of all beholders' responses to things."

15: "Metaphysical conviction can lead in this way to distortion or
misunderstanding of what we actually say and believe even in the most
familiar everyday judgements we are trying to understand."

16: "What is the source of the sense that metaphysics has a stronger
claim to correctness or illumination than what we accept as part of
the world without any metaphysical help?"

*** On Certainty

- 54 :: For it is not true that a mistake merely gets more and more
        improbable as we pass from the planet to my own hand.  No: at
        some point it has ceased to be conceivable.  \\ This is
        already suggested by the following: if it were not so, it
        would also be conceivable that we should be wrong in _every_
        statement about physical objects; that any we ever make are
        mistaken.

- 56 :: When one says: "Perhaps this planet doesn't exist and the
        light-phenomenon arises in some other way", then after all one
        needs an example of an object that does exist.  This doesn't
        exist,---as _for example_ does... // Or are we to say that
        certainty is merely a constructed point to which some things
        approximate more, some less closely?  No. Doubt gradually
        loses its sense.  This language-game just _is_ like that.

        disturbance, perhaps a transient one.

- 74 :: Can we say: a _mistake_ doesn't only have a cause, it also has
        a ground?  I.e., roughly: when someone makes a mistake, this
        can be fitted into what he knows aright.

- 115 :: If you tried to doubt everything you would not get as far as
         doubting anything.  The game of doubting itself presupposes
         certainty.

- 141 :: When we first begin to _believe_ anything, what we believe is
         not a single proposition, it is a whole system of
         propositions.  (Light dawns gradually over the whole.)

- 155 :: In certain circumstances a man cannot make a _mistake_.

         those propositions which he declares certain, we should not
         just share his opinion: we should regard him as demented.

***** Chapter 4, Section 9: The argument from vagueness
> Under what conditions do objects come into and go out of existence?
  (120)

Sider treats this as a question about conditions on *composition*.  He
claims that composition is unrestricted---any "class" of objects
composes another object.

****** 9.1: unrestricted mereological composition
> If not every class has a fusion then there must be a restriction on
composition.  Moreover, the only plausible restrictions on composition
would be vague ones.  But there can be no vague restrictions on
composition, because that would mean that whether composition occurs
is sometimes vague.  Therefore, every class has a fusion (p. 121).

- P1 :: If not every class has a fusion, then there must be a pair of
        cases connected by a continuous series such that in one,
        composition occurs, but in the other, composition does not
        occur.
- P2 :: In no continuous series is there a sharp cut-off in whether
        composition occurs. (cf. Markosian)
- P3 :: In any case of composition, either composition definitely
        occurs, or composition definitely does not occur.

P3 relies on the _linguistic theory of vagueness_ (roughly, the view
that vagueness is a fact about our language and thought, not about the
world; it is due to "semantic indecision")

- (F) :: There is some object, x, such that (1) every member of C is
         part of x, and (2) every part of x shares a part in common
         with some member of C.

This open sentence says that the class of objects C compose the object
x.  Sider claims that if some instance of (F) has vague or
indeterminate truth-conditions, then it is because there is vagueness
in the terms used to express the sentence.  "(F), however, apparently
contains no vague singular terms" (126).

(see also Sider's porky-pig sentence, p. 127)

The "crucial assumption" is that "logical words are never a source of
vagueness" (128).

Another assumption is that there are not multiple equally good
precisifications of the logical terms---in particular, the
quantifiers.  (I.e., no quantifier variance.)

> Anyone who accepts that logic is non-vague must also accept
  unrestricted composition. (132)

****** 9.2: composition questions and temporally indexed parthood
1. "when a given class has a fusion at a given time" (133)

**** Hawthorne, "3D vs 4D"
***** Spacetime
"three theses central to the picture at hand:"

- Pointiness :: Every space-time region is composed of point-sized
                parts.
- Universality :: Every collection of space-time points composes
                  something.
- Uniqueness :: For every collection of space-time points there is
                exactly one thing that is composed of the space- time
                points in that collection.
- Pointy Object Fundamentality :: Points are ontologically more
     fundamental than extended regions.
- Pointy Fact Fundamentality :: Facts about points and the relations
     between them are more fundamental than facts about extended
     regions.

Most four-dimensionalists accept these theses.

****** Spatiotemporalism
The thesis that material objects _are_ the spacetime regions they
occupy.

- Modal objection :: David Lewis might have lived another year, but
     the space-time region he (actually) occupied could not have
     lasted longer than it did.

- Ordinary language objection :: Space-time regions don't walk to the
     grocery.

***** Four-Dimensionalism
"Physical objects are thought to be built out of simple material parts
that have zero spatial and temporal extent, and any collection of such
simples is held to compose one and only one material object.  On such
a picture, the last of the worries mentioned for spatiotemporalism no
longer arises: since point-sized material objects are not identified
with points, then there is no principled difficulty in allowing two of
them to occupy the same spatiotemporal point."

Adoption of *Uniqueness* causes problems for four-dimensionalists
(Lumpl and Goliath).

****** Drop Uniqueness?
"what should we make of a position that embraces Pointiness and
Universality for material objects (call this combination ‘Plenitude’)?
The defender of Plenitude holds that everything is made of point sized
things, and that every collection of point sized things makes up
something, but allows that there may be a number of things made of the
very same point sized things.  She is therefore well placed to
maintain that even when a quantity of steel and a ship made of the
steel have exactly the same point-sized parts, they are not
identical."

Motivating the plenitude: If there could be an archipelago made up of
an island, a rusting ship, and a toppled tower, why shouldn't there be
arbitrary scattered objects?

***** Fundamentality
Problems with the relation of things to their points; Kripke et. al.

***** Three-Dimensionalism
****** "Wholly present"
According to the 'serious tenser', the claim that I am spread out in
time has no more merit that the claim that I am spread out across many
possible worlds: one should no more reconstrue what was and will be as
a series of additional concrete realities that I inhabit than one
should reconstrue what might be as a series of additional concrete
worlds that I inhabit."

Analogues with 'bi-location'.

**** Vagueness arguments
***** Koslicki on Sider
<<koslicki>> on [[sider-v][Sider 4.9]]

Summary of the Sider/Lewis argument against vague composition:

> The only acceptable account of vagueness is the account which
  locates the source of vagueness in language and thought: vagueness
  is a matter of semantic indecision.  But the question of whether a
  given plurality of objects compose something can be formulated in a
  part of language which does not contain any vague vocabulary.
  Therefore, the question of whether a given plurality of objects
  compose something can never receive a vague answer. (113)

If we disagree with Sider over the truth-value of a sentence like
"There exist n objects", what is the source of our disagreement?
Koslicki believes that it involves the *range* (not the *meaning*) of
the existential quantifier:

> There is no reason why they should not agree on what '$\exists$'
  means, but they nevertheless disagree on _what_ exists and _how
  many_ things exist: in other words, they disagree on what it means
  to be an _object_. (119)

Whether "There exist n objects" is true therefore depends on how many
things the quantifier ranges over.  How many things it ranges over
depends in part on how many fusions occur.  And whether or not it is
vague whether a given fusion occurs is just what is at issue.

(Sider's reply doesn't make sense.)

****** Problems with the plenitude
Because of the massive amount of fusions and whatnot,
four-dimensionalism (and 'promiscuous' three-dimensionalism) lose
sight of one of the original problems: discovering persistence
conditions for everyday objects like houses and pizzas.  Because these
objects have no privileged metaphysical status, questions about their
persistence are really just questions about our conceptual framework:

> Sider is guilty of a bit of false advertising: his account is really
  a way of saying that, at the end of the day, there is no interesting
  ontological story to be told about the persistence of our familiar
  concrete objects of common-sense; whatever there is to say about the
  persistence of houses, trees, people and cars concerns the
  organization of our conceptual household. (125)

(This certainly seems to make things easier.)

'Genidentity' and [[spinning discs]]

*Why* does the trout-turkey exist?  Koslicki thinks existence 'comes
 too cheaply'.  But why should it be expensive?

**** Spinning discs
# <<spinning discs>>

What exactly is the thought experiment?

- A completely homogenous spinning disc is qualitatively
  indistinguishable from a stationary disc if we assume 4D?
  - But how is this *possible*?  Any superficially homogenous disc is
    actually composed of atoms and so has a non-homogenous structure.
    We could _see_ the movement of the atoms in the spinning disc.  So
    we are apparently supposed to imagine a hunk of matter that is
    _not composed of atoms_.  This seems impossible.
  - Another possibility is that at _each instant_ the atoms of the
    spinning disc are in an identical position as atoms of the
    stationary disc.  Each 'snapshot' shows that the atoms of the
    spinning disc have moved far enough to become 'in line with' the
    atoms of the stationary disc.  But this would assume that space
    and/or time are discrete, which is a bold empirical hypothesis.
- Either way, the spinning disc objection to four-dimensionalism makes
  no sense to me.

If a 'block' of matter is _completely_ homogeneous, then it has no
structure.  There is no 'natural' way to split it up; it has no
internal divisions.  In other words, it _has no proper parts_.  What
things have no proper parts?  Simples!  So the objection to
four-dimensionalism is really just one about simples.  The objection
is that four-dimensionalism can't account for the rotation of simples.

Is it still a valid objection?  At the very least, Sider's
presentation of it becomes problematic:

> Imagine two duplicate, homogeneous, continuous, perfectly circular
  disks of uniform depth: one stationary, the other rotating.  The
  genidentity relation must hold in different patterns between the
  temporal parts of the bits of the two discs: it must hold in
  straight lines through spacetime in the case of the stationary disc,
  and in a helical pattern in the case of the rotating disc (225).

Perhaps Sider is being knowingly cagey with his use of 'bits' here;
the 'bits of the two discs' certainly aren't _parts_; simples don't
have parts.  And yet:

> The _three_-dimensionalist has an easy answer.  There are no
  temporal parts, and so no genidentity relation, and so no need for
  an analysis of genidentity.  The enduring parts of the disc will be
  located at different places depending on whether the disc rotates
  (226).

What enduring parts?  The four-dimensionalist does not have to account
for the temporal parts of the parts of the disc, for there are no such
parts.  What she _does_ have to do is explain what the rotation of
simples looks like.  But isn't this a problem for the
three-dimensionalist as well?

Let's suppose that point-sized simples can't rotate.  They have no
extension, so there doesn't seem to be any plausible way in which they
could.  Our problem concerns _extended simples_.

Are these even possible?  A number of questions arise if we
countenance this possibility:

1. Are they divisible?
   Presumably, if there are extended simples, then they may come in a
   variety of sizes.  We've got our disks (spinning and stationary),
   but why not spheres, cubes, and stars?  McDaniel (I think) even has
   a lamp-shaped simple on his wish list.  But once we've got all
   these fancy simples, what happens if we try to break them into
   pieces?  Can I split the disk into crescent-shaped halves?  Can I
   pull a point off a star?
   - If yes, then I seem to have _created_ a piece of the star (or
     disk).  For the point of the star is part of the star, but the
     star was supposed to have no (proper) parts.  So perhaps the star
     is now a scattered simple?  The fact that we can even talk about
     the parts of the star (its points) is difficult to reconcile with
     the supposed lack of parts.
   - If no, then we've got a hunk of matter that is completely
     indestructible.

2. Are they malleable?

***** Pointing and parts <2011-12-05 Mon>
****** The problem
The idea is that the three-dimensionalist can 'point to' (or otherwise
identify) a section ('bit') of the spinning disc at t1, and then point
at _that same section_ (re-identifying it) at t2.  She can then say
"This very same section (bit) was there, and now is here.  Hence,
motion!"  The four-dimensionalist, on the other hand, is supposed to
be in trouble.  She apparently has to point at the temporal part of
the 'section' at t1, and the (numerically distinct!) temporal part of
the 'section' at t2.  Having pointed out these two 'parts', she then
needs some criterion of 'genidentity' connecting the two temporal
parts.  But none seems forthcoming.
****** What problem?
But once we recognize that the spinning disc has no proper parts and
is therefore a simple, this problem doesn't make a lot of sense.

1. Can we really point _at_ the 'sections'?  They are not proper parts
   of the disc, and so it seems that they do not actually
   _exist_---they are 'mental' or theoretical divisions.  (Scala on
   [[point_parts][pointing to 'parts']])

2. Even supposing we could point at these arbitrary areas of the disc,
   how is the three-dimensionalist (or anyone) supposed to re-identify
   them?  There can be no question of picking out _numerically the
   same_ section---these 'sections' are theoretical divisions that
   correspond to nothing in reality.
   - If it is an extended simple, then we can of course re-identify
     the same 'section' if we know the rotation of the disc.  If we
     know that the disc is spinning at a given RPM, we can 'identify'
     the matter lying between two degrees and calculate where that
     matter will be for any other time.  But this technique is
     available to both three- and four-dimensionalists.
***** Scala: spinning simples
> In part, Zimmerman's argument trades on the willingness of some
temporal-parts theorists to admit the possibility of the homogeneous
spheres, an admission he lauds.For it is difficult to see any _prima
facie_ reason to deny their possibility. What's more, a change of mind
regarding their possibility in light of difficulties they cause for
one's favored doctrine of persistence betrays bad faith. This
increases the pressure to abandon the doctrine of temporal parts,
Zimmerman thinks.

> But perhapsthe situation is not desperate.  Consider another sort of
thing that, I believe, might exist: an extended simple (393--394).

The spinning sphere/disk _is_ an extended simple.

> the atoms I am envisioning are indivisible in a stronger sense, for
  they have no proper parts.  A simple, in my sense, occupies a
  greater than point-size region of space and is indivisible because
  it does not have, for instance, a right or a left half.  To look at
  one, you would think you can distinguish a right from a left half,
  but looks aren't everything. When you think you point to a part of
  the atom, I say you are pointing at all of it or nothing at all
  (394).
# <<point_parts>>

_If_ an extended simple is possible, then presumably it can be half
blue and half red.  How are we to describe this?

> I will tend to say not that it is partly blue and partly red,
  because I think that is false, or misleading at best. Instead, I say
  the atom is red at one region and blue at the other (395).

> Now, suppose that there are two simple, homogeneous spheres, one of
  which is rotating and the other of which is not. The endurantist
  obviously cannot apply her strategy for dealing with non-simple,
  homogeneous spheres, for that strategy relied upon tracing of
  parts through time.

there, antecedently to any conventions; if it weren't, there'd be
nothing to draw the lines on.' (11)

along the lines of this analogy, are countries there prior to the
drawing of boundaries? we speak of "what is now Turkey", and it
doesn't seem false to say that Turkey didn't exist 3000 years ago
(otherwise Ataturk would have had little to do).

are some material objects like countries in this respect? they
certainly exist as more than verbal conventions or 'political

that tables are not real"; "...not true objects"; "...not

But I do not deny this. In fact, I affirm it." (100)

uttering 'There are two very valuable chairs in the next room' on a

writing the words 'There are no chairs'." (101)

Re: Copernicus, is it even strictly false that the sun moved behind
the elms?

"'The sun moved behind the elms' is not, even from the point of view
of the most fanatical astronomical literalist, a report of a
nonexistent, fabricated, or imaginary even; it is not like, say, 'The
sun moved rapidly back and forth across the sky'. It may describe an
actual event in a misleading or loose or even a wrong way, but the
event it describes is there to be described and
misdescribed. Something very similar may be said about 'There are two
very valuable chairs |102| in the next room'. This sentence, when it
is successfully used to report a fact, does report a fact about the
existence of _something_. This much is shown by the fact that if the
next room were wholly empty of matter, then what was expressed by this
sentence would be false by anyone's standard." (101--102)

van Inwagen's treatment of loose truth and loose-truthmakers requires
that for an proposition with existential entailment to be loosely
true, there must be _something_ that does exist.

> "when people say things in the ordinary business of life by uttering
sentences that start 'There are chairs...' or 'There are stars...',
they very often say things that are literally true...I can say this
because I accept certain theses in the philosophy of language. Some

that when I said "It is and it isn't" and "The sun moved behind the
elms," I said something false. If I agreed with them, I could not
reply to the Moore-style objection to my ontology in the way I have."
(102)

- What are these theses? Apparently not the Gricean/Bacchic
  distinction between saying and stating. According to that thesis,
  what you _said_ ("It is and it isn't") was false, but what you
  _meant_ ("It's drizzly") is true.

- So does van Inwagen think that when you say "It is and it isn't",
  you mean _just that_? If so, anyone ought to agree that you said
  something false.

- So van Inwagen must think that _what you actually said_ (and so
  meant) was "It's drizzly".

- Really? Because page 106 ("he really means that there are two
  valuable chairs in the next room.")

- So what the hell is going on?

that 'The sun moved behind the elms' expresses a falsehood, he must
still have some way to distinguish between this sentence and those

the vulgar would regard as the sentences that expressed falsehoods

think that I regarded utterers of this sentence as he (perhaps) regard
utterers of the sentence 'There are two horrible ghosts in the next
house'. But my assertion (and yours and his) that there are no ghosts
is not like my assertion that in Pluralia there are no bligers. My
assertion that in Pluralia there are no bligers is not meant to deny
that reports of bligers are reports of a real and unified set of
phenomena. My assertion that there are no ghosts is meant to deny that
reports of ghosts are reports of a real and unified set of
phenomena. When people say they see ghosts, I believe (and I presume
you do, too) that either there is nothing there, or, if there is
something there, it's not the same sort of thing on each occasion."

> "My assertion that in Pluralia there are no bligers is not meant to

are clearly defined parts of the bliger and it's easily seen how they
fit together. A bliger is, e.g., 'four monkeys, a sloth, and an owl in

tablewise arrangements of simples.] But that is something that you
will not convey to the ordinary man when you tell him that I think
that there are no chairs, just as you would not have conveyed to the
sixteenth-century ordinary man what Copernicus believed about the
motion of the sun if you told him that, according to Copernicus, the
sun does not move."

Yes you would! That's what made his thesis so revolutionary.

***** Section 11

> "If I am right, then all facts of the sort that most philosophers
would say were facts about artifacts, and about nonliving "natural"
objects like stones, are facts about the arrangement of simples. [???]
If this position is, as I have been arguing, not absurd, then it
should be possible to paraphrase the sentences of ordinary language
that most philosophers would say expressed facts about things like
chairs in language that refers to no material things but simples."
(108)

- If facts _about_ $x$ are really _about_ $y$, and we can say
  (literally true!) things like "there is a red chair in the room"
  (and mean it!), then presumably van Inwagen is making some appeal to
  the underlying logical structure of the language. Unbeknownst to us,
  we are really performing plural reference, rather than singular
  (just as "the plumber is pernicious" is a general proposition?).

- But classic paraphrases are used to _preserve_ the intuitively
  correct truth-values. "There is no King of France" becomes $\neg
  \exists x$ etc etc. "There is a Queen of England" becomes $\exists
  x$ etc etc. And in the second, positive claim, both the English and
  notational versions entail the existence of the Queen of France. So,
  if "There are some chairs\,\... " becomes $\exists xs arranged
  chairwise$ etc, why should not both entail the existence of chairs?

- Other paraphrases are used to show that the original statement _is_
  false, but loosely true. For example, "Love exists" might be
  paraphrased as $\exists x \wedge \exists y and Lyx$. The whole point
  of this is so that our cynical philosopher can say that, strictly
  speaking, love doesn't exist (what the romantic said was false). Van
  Inwagen, on the other hand, wants to still say that strictly
  speaking, chairs exist. (Doesn't he? At least he wants to say that
  the ordinary man didn't say anything false.)

  + $\exists x Lx$ entails the existence of love.

  + $\exists x Tx$ entails the existence of a table.



> "Our answer to the SCQ entails that there are no material objects
but organisms and simples, and our suggested technique of paraphrasing
enables us to escape some of the more embarrassing consequences of
this position. When someone says "Some tables are heavier than some
chairs," there is obviously something right about what he says. Our
technique of paraphrasis enables us to capture what it is that is
right about what he says---or so is my hope." (111)

> "We are now ready to consider a paraphrase of 'Some chairs are
heavier than some tables': There are $x$s that are arranged chairwise
and there are $y$ that are arranged tablewise and the $x$s are heavier
than the $y$s." (109)

> "There are, we suppose, no tables; we philosophers who supposed that
things sometimes added up to tables were mistaken. There is, we
maintain, no table over there, but only certain things arranged
tablewise. But if we are going to refer to those things, in lieu of
referring to a table, we shall need to call them something---say,
'those things over there that are arranged tablewise'. And if we are
going to translate multiply quantified sentences involving
physical-object common nouns like 'table' into sentences involving no
physical-object common nouns, or none but 'simple', then we shall have
to employ some device that allows us to "mimic" the quantificational
structure of the original sentences---" (110)

> "I shall sometimes make assertions by writing sentences that contain
terms like 'table' and 'chair'. Whenever I do this, I am to be taken
as claiming to be able to produce a paraphrase of the sentence I have
written that, but for considerations of space and English prose style,
I should be willing to put in its place." (112)

> "paraphrases are not supposed to capture the meanings of their
originals...When the ordinary man utters the sentence 'Some chairs are
heavier than some tables' (in an appropriate context, and so on and so
on), he expresses a certain proposition, and one that is almost
certainly true. But I do not claim that this proposition _is_ the
proposition that, for some $x$s, those $x$s are arranged chairwise and
for some $y$s, those $y$s are arranged tablewise, and the $x$s are
heavier than the $y$s. If these are two distinct propositions, what is
the relation between them in virtue of which the latter is a
"paraphrase" of the former (or the sentence expressing the latter is a
paraphrase of the sentence expressing the former)? [Copernicus] (112)

(A) The paraphrase describes the same fact as the original.

(B) The paraphrase, unlike the original, does not even appear to imply
that there are any objects that occupy chair-receptacles.

(C) The paraphrase is neutral with respect to competing metaphysical
theories, _viz_. the "received" theory, that there are objects that
occupy chair-receptacles, and the theory I have proposed, according to
which there are no such objects.

(D) The original, though it doubtless does not express the same
proposition as the paraphrase, has the feature ascribed to the
paraphrase in (C): It is neutral with respect to the question whether
there are objects that fit exactly into chair-receptacles." (113)

Whether or not "The sun moved behind the elms" entails that the sun
moved (it does), it sure does entail that the sun exists. Likewise,
"Some chairs..." sure does entail that chairs exist.

Probably!

***** Section 17

the slide from 'would' to 'did' (or 'does'):

> "Assume I exist. Then certain simples compose me. Call them
'M'. Now, a single simple is a negligible item indeed. Let $x$ be one
of these negligible parts of me---one that is somewhere in my right
arm, say. Now consider the simples that compose me _other than_ $x$
('M -- $x$'). Since $x$ is so very negligible, M -- $x$ _could_ [my
emphasis] compose a human being just as well as M could. We may say
that M and M -- $x$ are "equally well suited" to compose human
beings. And, of course, for _any_ simple $y$, "M -- $y$ will be as
well suited to compose a human being as M are. Moreover, it would be
surprising indeed if there were not a simple $z$ such that "M + $z$"
were as well suited to compose a human being as M are. It would, in
fact (if I may once more use this phrase), be intolerably arbitrary to
say that M composed a human being although M -- $x$ _didn't_ [my
emphasis] and M -- $y$ _didn't_ [my emphasis] and M + $z$ _didn't_ [my
emphasis]. Suppose, therefore, that M -- $x$ et al.\ _do_ [my
emphasis] compose human beings." (215)

What would be arbitrary would be to suppose that M -- $x$ etc _would
not_ compose human beings. And we've agreed to that in the first
half. All we are therefore entitled to suppose is that M -- $x$ et
al.\ _would_ compose human beings if $x$ were removed---just as my
house of blocks -- block A4 _would be_ a house of blocks if I removed
A4.

Unger's presuppositions

1) In every situation of which we should ordinarily say that it
   contained just one man, there are many sets of simples whose
   members are as suitably arranged to compose men as any simples
   could be. [false]

2) The members of each of these sets compose something. [false]

3) Each of these "somethings" is a man, provided there are any men at
   all. [false]

**** Replies to reviewers
> "Let me revert once more to my Copernican analogy. Someone who says,
'I don't understand what van Inwagen means when he says that trees
exist but apples don't' corresponds to someone who says, 'I don't
understand what Copernicus means when he says that clouds move but the
sun doesn't.' (711--712)

NOPE. Problem is that all the designating terms in the Copernican
example pick out things in the world, while, ex hypothesi, 'apples'
does not. There is nothing to understand by the world 'apples' on van
Inwagen's theory.

"'But you couldn't understand "chairwise" unless you first understood
"chair".' I think that this statement is false, for reasons that I
give in the footnote that Rosenberg mentions. But suppose it is
true. What are its untoward consequences for my metaphysical position?
It obviously does not entail that I couldn't understand' chairwise'
unless there were, in the strict and philosophical sense, chairs,
[cf. Hirch on the coherency of *this*] and I don't see how it can have
untoward consequences for my metaphysical position if it does not have
that entailment. (Rosenberg, who as I said, understands "chairwise",
presumably also understands "golden-mountain-wise"; grant for the sake
of argument that he could not understand this ungainly adverb unless
he understood "golden mountain"; it obviously does not follow that he
could not understand "golden-mountain-wise" if there were no golden
mountains.) (719)

- golden mountains are not metaphysically impossible (except according
    to van Inwagen); we do _not_ understand 'round square(-wise)'.

> "It is easy to see how to define 'chairwise' in terms of 'chair'
without supposing that there are any chairs. Let a "chair" be defined
as an object that has the properties C_{1}, C_{2},\,\dots\,C_{n}. (I
am sure that Rosenberg and I could agree on a property-list definition
of 'chair'.)

1. Suppose we have such a definition: "a chair is an object with four
sections [legs] 1x1x10" placed each at the corners of a 10x10" square;
resting on these sections is another section [seat] that is 10x10x1",
and placed upon one terminal 1" part of this section is another
section 10x1x10". Each of these sections are glued together."

2. Now how is 'chairwise' defined in terms of this definition?

3. "simples are arranged chairwise iff some of the simples occupy each
   of four regions of space 1x1x10", these regions placed each at the
   corners of a 10x10 square; some other of the simples occupy a
   region of space 10x10x1" that borders the tops of the first four
   regions; the remainder of the simples occupy a region of space
   10x1x10" that borders a 1x10" area on the top and at the edge of
   the 10x10x1" region; the simples in each region that border other
   regions are bonded [however wood-glue bonds] with the simples in
   the other region."

*** Ontology and verbal disputes
**** Paper notes
Sider's 'backup strategy' for dealing with Hirsch is to stipulate---in
concert with other metaphysicians---that they use "existence" and
related terms in a special sense:

> [The philosophers] should stipulate that their quantifiers are to be
  understood as theoretical terms (and so are not subject to the same
  level of metasemantic pressure from charity that governs terms like
  'sofa' and 'game') that stand for whatever joint-carving notion is
  in the vicinity. (9)

By explicitly _intending_ to mean by 'exists' (and its relatives)
whatever 'joint-carving' notion is 'closest', Sider hopes to evade
Hirsch's argument from interpretive charity.  The idea is that one can
(in special cases) put charity on hold.

But it is not immediately clear why this should be expected to work.
Recall Hirsch's strategy: in the recent ontological disputes, it is
possible to interpret each side so that nobody actually disagrees.
This requires interpreting David Lewis and Peter van Inwagen, for
example, as meaning different things by their uses of the
quantifiers.  Roughly, when DL says that there is something composed
of the table and the eraser, he just means the same as the rest of us
mean by "there is a table and an eraser".  Likewise, when van Inwagen
asserts that there are no tables, he just means what we would express
as "there are no organisms or simples that are also tables".

Obviously, David Lewis and van Inwagen disagree.  Hirsch's
'interpretations' have the result that our distinguished
metaphysicians are putting forward truisms, like "everything that is
an organism or simple is an organism or simple".  When van Inwagen
said "everything is an organism or simple" he _thought_ he was making
a bold metaphysical claim.  Not according to Hirsch.

Hirsch's interpretations are therefore _hostile_.  They diverge
substantially from the intentions of the speakers.  Even if they both
tell Hirsch "we're _not_ engaged in a verbal dispute", Hirsch will be
unmoved:

> The presumption of charity is supposed to be an a priori principle
  that is partially constitutive of linguistic meaning.  Insofar as
  the disputing ontologists assert the sentence, "We are not engaged
  in a verbal dispute," this sentence will figure, together with all
  the other asserted sentences, in arriving at the most charitable
  interpretation. I would suspect that meta-level, quasi-technical
  (self-aggrandizing) assertions probably have low priority as
  supplicants for charity. In any case, it can't be seriously
  suggested that the charitable presumption in favor of the
  correctness of this one assertion threatens to trump the presumption
  in favor of all of the other assertions made by the
  ontologists. (515)

So why can't Hirsch simply do the same thing when Sider announces the
introduction of 'Ontologese'?  Suppose each ontologist recites "I
hereby intend to use the quantifiers $\exists$ and $\forall$ such that
they correspond with whatever fundamental quantificational notions are
in the vicinity".  Then presumably Hirsch will interpret each
ontologist differently, so that their subsequent statements come out
true.  He could just take each to mean different things by "$\exists$"
and "$\forall$".  So what's Sider's move?

He claims that in certain local contexts, charity can be suspended.
When those engaged in a particular sort of talk would rather be wrong
for the right reason than right for the wrong, they demand that
charity be withheld from a given term (or terms).  Sider's example is
from physics:

> Consider a debate amongst some scientists over whether simultaneity
  is transitive.  Imagine that certain proponents of special
  relativity say that it's not, on one meaning of 'simultaneity'
  anyway, on which spacelike separated objects count as simultaneous.
  Someone in the debate then raises the question of whether it's
  analytic, given the usual meaning of 'simultaneity', that
  simultaneity is transitive.  This consideration is clearly
  irrelevant to the scientific debate, and the scientists recognize it
  as such.  They don't care about this facet of ordinary usage; what
  they care about is the structure of the fundamental temporal facts.
  So they agree to set aside this facet of the ordinary usage of
  'simultaneous' for the sake of the dispute.

But this does not appear to support Sider's claim.  Here theoretical
utility and charity go hand in hand.  For here it _would_ be
charitable to interpret the scientists' uses of 'simultaneous' as
meaning something other than the 'usual meaning'.  If we did interpret
them as meaning the 'usual meaning', they would be making (in Hirsch's
words) 'a priori false assertions'; they would be doubting whether or
not simultaneity is transitive, when it is part of the meaning of
'simultaneity' that it is transitive.  It would be like someone
doubting whether or not all bachelors are unmarried.  So this example
is not a case of 'trumping' or overriding charity.
***** Can stipulations ever trump charity?
In the cases of both the ontologists and the scientists, someone
listening to them with no background information might take them to be
saying obviously false things.  "What do they mean, there don't exist
any chairs"; "What do they mean, is simultaneity transitive?"  To make
sense of their utterances, our speaker needs to interpret them
charitably; they shouldn't be taken to mean what our listener means.
She will perhaps understand the ontologist to mean something special
by 'exist' and the scientist by 'simultaneity'.  In the latter case
she would obviously be right in doing so.

So if Sider's gambit is to work, we need an example where the
stipulated meaning goes _against_ charity.  A listener must initially
take them to be saying obviously _true_ things, and must be convinced
that they are saying something else, something which might render what
they say false.
****** Aside: charity everywhere?
Charity does seem pretty ubiquitous.  It plays role in metaphor:

"Love is blind"---well, she can't mean that literally, so she must
have some metaphorical meaning (charity is closely related to the
cooperative principle)

Is the cooperative principle a special instance of charity?
'Conversational charity'?
***** Back to Sider
OK, we need some examples.

The problem is that in the normal charity cases, we take what seems
false and interpret it to be true.  But now we're supposed to take
something true and interpret it to be true in some other way.

What makes the first type of case possible is the fact that, given
what the word usually means, the proposition expressed can't be true
("There are no chairs").  So we cast around for a meaning that will
make it true ("There are no simples that are chairs").  In the second
case, the usual meaning works just fine in making the proposition
true.  The speaker therefore has to explicitly stipulate a new meaning
that allows us to evaluate the utterance as true or false.  Sider's
"let $\exists$ mean the closest joint-carving notion" is not
sufficient.

An example.  "Can two people fall in love?"

"Well, of course."

"Ah, but by 'love' I don't mean the silly infatuations that lead to
marriage today.  I mean the kind of love that unites two souls in an
indestructible embrace.  By 'love' I mean total interpenetration of
our immortal Cartesian minds."

"..."

"So, do you think two people can fall in love?"

"No."

Our imagined idealist will presumably go on to deny that anyone he has
ever known has fallen in love, that nobody is likely to fall in love
in these dark times, etc.  

But now it is _charity_ that demands that we interpret him as meaning
by 'love' exactly what he said he means; if we took him to be using
'love' in its usual sense, then we would be forced to regard all these
utterances as false.

Let's run it again:

"Can two people fall in love?"

"Well, of course."

"Oh, but don't take me to be using 'love' in the ordinary sense.
Rather, I intend to use 'love' to pick out the most _fundamental_
notion in the vicinity, whatever it may be."

"..."

"So, do you think two people can fall in love?"

"Yes."

Our listener can have no idea what this fundamental notion is supposed
to be, and is therefore required to rely on the only notion she
has---that expressed by 'love' in its ordinary sense.

It's possible that she might not say "Yes".  It's possible that
instead she might simply say "You are no longer making sense.  I do
not understand what you mean by 'love', if not love---and I do not
think you understand yourself".

So Hirsch has two options here.  When Sider says

"When I say '$\exists$', do not understand me as using it in the
ordinary sense.  Rather, I intend to use it to pick out the most
fundamental notion in the vicinity, whatever that may be.  Now,
keeping all that in mind, let us ask ourselves: do chairs exist?"

Hirsch may reply "Yes", or he may say "I no longer understand you."
**** Sider, "Ontological realism"
> The deflationist must therefore concede a disanalogy between the
  PVI/DKL dispute and paradigmatic merely verbal disputes.  A merely
  verbal dispute over whether geese live by the "bank" can be resolved
  by a shift in vocabulary.  One side will be happy for her word
  'bank' to be translated as 'river bank', the other for his word
  'bank' to be translated as 'financial bank'; and each will agree
  that geese live only by the river bank.  These non-hostile
  translations are mutually acceptable to the disputants, and the
  dispute evaporates once they are introduced.

> The fact that the deflationist's translations are hostile certainly
  means that he cannot use them as an offensive weapon, to force PVI
  and DKL to concede that they do not genuinely disagree.  But nor
  does this fact give the realist an offensive weapon against the
  deflationist.  For it is no part of the deflationist's position that
  warring ontologists be able to tell "from the inside" that they are
  talking past one another.  The deflationist thinks, rather, that
  there simply are no questions like those that the ontologists are
  trying to ask.  They are trying to fix on a single distinguished
  quantifier meaning, but the attempt does not succeed.  The
  translations assign the only sensible contents to the words of the
  misguided warring parties. (14)

> The central question of metaontology is that of whether there are
  many equally good quantifier meanings, or whether there is a single
  best quantifier meaning.  It is a question about nature's joints; it
  is a question of _how much quantificational structure the world
  contains_. (15)

> Thus, if *existence* is insufficiently magnetic to trump a poor fit
  with use, Equivocation, Obviousness, or Indeterminacy might well be
  _true about the English quantifier 'there exists'_.  But in that
  case, PVI and DKL can simply recast their dispute directly in terms
  of *existence*.  They can introduce a _new_ language in which to
  conduct their debate, using the following performance:

>> Let's give the speakers of ordinary English 'there exists'; let us
  henceforth conduct our debate using '$\exists$'. We hereby stipulate
  that '$\exists$' is to express an austere relative of the ordinary
  English notion of existence. We hereby stipulate that although the
  meaning of '$\exists$' is to obey the core inferential role of
  English quantifiers, ordinary, casual use of disputed sentences
  involving 'there exists' (such as 'Tables exist') are not to affect
  at all what we mean by '$\exists$'.  We hereby stipulate that if
  there is a highly natural meaning that satisfies these constraints,
  then that is what we mean by '$\exists$'.  Perhaps the resulting
  '$\exists$' has no synonym in English.  Fine---we hereby dub our new
  language _Ontologese_.
**** Hirsch, "Language, Ontology, and Structure"
> I do agree with McGrath’s claim that charity to perception is weaker
  in the philosophical communities than in ordinary communities in
  which perceptual judgments about the existence of highly visible
  macroscopic objects do not appear to be based on conscious
  inferences from general principles.  But this point must not be
  overstated.  The distinction between conscious and unconscious
  inference is notoriously nebulous.  Probably all perception is
  theory-laden in some ways or to some degree.  The fact is that the
  philosophical communities do make perceptual judgments, such as,
  "There is no composite object here," said by members of the
  O-community in the presence of a table.  Nothing that McGrath has
  said about the distinctive nature of the philosophical communities
  seems to undermine the claim that there is an overwhelming
  presumption in favor of charitably interpreting each side as
  employing a language in which its assertions, both general and
  perceptual, come out true. (514--515)

> But why isn't it right for us to criticize their language as being
  expressively defective, if in their language they are able to
  express fewer s-facts than we can in ours?  I think this puzzling
  question may motivate us to reject the restrictive view of s-facts,
  or even to reject s-facts altogether.  If we hold on to the
  restrictive view we must say that there is no value as such in
  expressing s-facts.  We must say that the speech act that in
  O∗-English is called "expressing an s-fact," even if this act does
  not constitute (what we call) expressing an s-fact, has no less
  value than (what we call) expressing an s-fact.  This is why we
  cannot say that their language is defective, and they cannot say
  that ours is.  If this formulation seems too paradoxical, then we
  must give up the restrictive view. (518--519)

> If we do not believe in s-facts we will say that a u-fact is in a
  sense divided up in different ways by the structures of the
  sentences that can express it.  We may perhaps consider there to be
  something of value in being able to express u-facts in structurally
  different ways (in being able to see the facts under the aspect of
  different sentential structures).  That value, such as it might be,
  is all the value that the restricted view can assign to expressing
  s-facts.  This is why, on that view, the speech act that in
  O∗-English is called "expressing an s-fact" has no less value than
  (what we call) expressing an s-fact. (519)

> What Sider evidently wants is that such principles as P and Q should
  hold in a privileged sense of "existence" (in the sense of
  _Existence_, with capitals and italics), the sense belonging to the
  best ontological language.  The trouble is that precisely what the
  neophyte neo-ontologists need from him is an explanation of what it
  means for one ontological language to be better than another.  As
  things stand each ontological camp will have as much reason as any
  other to regard as privileged the sense of "existence" in its
  ontological language.  This is why one gets the feeling that Sider
  is trying to issue his explanations from a position outside any of
  the ontological languages.  This, however, he cannot do.  The
  philosophers who enter the neo-room have no alternative but to
  understand his explanations in terms of the different ontological
  languages they initially bring with them. (522)
**** Sider, "Hirsch's attack on ontologese"
> Second, one might think that there’s an important distinction
  between ordinary terms and "theoretical terms", terms that have
  built into their meanings (or at least built into their
  metasemantics) that they are to stand for joint-carving meanings.
  The metasemantics of theoretical terms in science, on this view, is
  less charity-based than is the metasemantics of ordinary terms like
  'sofa' and 'game'. Theoretical terms pick out whatever joint-carving
  meanings are in the "vicinity", and are only minimally governed by
  charity---not because of a global doctrine of reference magnetism, but
  rather because of something local to theoretical terms. Even Hirsch
  should admit that _some_ terms, such as certain terms of physics,
  function in this way. (2)

> The question is not whether one can speak a whole new language
  simply by announcing the intention to do so, but rather whether one
  can partially and locally suspend the considerations of charity that
  govern meaning---whether one can say: "assuming there is a
  joint-carving quantifier-meaning, if charity is getting in the way
  of our meaning it then let this aspect of charity be suspended". And
  I think one can do this. (4)

Sider's example is a scientific dispute over 'simultaneity':

> Consider a debate amongst some scientists over whether simultaneity
  is transitive.  Imagine that certain proponents of special
  relativity say that it's not, on one meaning of 'simultaneity'
  anyway, on which spacelike separated objects count as simultaneous.
  Someone in the debate then raises the question of whether it's
  analytic, given the usual meaning of 'simultaneity', that
  simultaneity is transitive.  This consideration is clearly
  irrelevant to the scientific debate, and the scientists recognize it
  as such.  They don't care about this facet of ordinary usage; what
  they care about is the structure of the fundamental temporal facts.
  So they agree to set aside this facet of the ordinary usage of
  'simultaneous' for the sake of the dispute.

But it appears that here it _would_ be charitable to interpret the
scientists' uses of 'simultaneous' as meaning something other than the
'usual meaning'.  If we did interpret them as such, they would be
making (in Hirsch's words) 'a priori false assertions'; they would be
doubting whether or not simultaneity is transitive, when it is part of
the meaning of 'simultaneity' that it is transitive.  It would be like
someone doubting whether or not all bachelors are unmarried.  So this
example is not a case of 'trumping' or overriding charity.

> I think that we have the ability to use words---whether pre-existing
  words or new words---in such a way that their metasemantics is not
  monomaniacally governed by charity.  Theoretical terms in science
  are commonly, and more or less self-consciously, used in this way.
  What I propose is that ontologists do the same with quantifiers.
  They should stipulate that their quantifiers are to be understood as
  theoretical terms (and so are not subject to the same level of
  metasemantic pressure from charity that governs terms like 'sofa'
  and 'game') that stand for whatever joint-carving notion is in the
  vicinity. (9)

It might be that Hirsch is relying on a 'monomaniacal' version of
interpretive charity.  He is already willing to perform 'hostile'
interpretations of other metaphysicians (and see his treatment of
"We're not engaged in a verbal dispute").  If our words mean whatever
they have to in order for what we say to be true, then Sider's appeal
to a special language is useless.  But Hirsch's notion of charity is
looking increasingly radical (there seems to be a connection between
it and meaning skepticism/interpretationism).

**** Hovda, "Tensed mereology"
In addition to the standard mereological terms, we are introduced to
the notion of a "condition":

> we will want a “condition” to be an open sentence that may have more
> than one free variable, _together with a specification of a target
> variable_. For example, we will want to consider “conditions” like
> “y loves x”, with “x” as target. This is because we want to

> that b is a fusion of the condition (with respect to x) “y loves x”
> (i.e., a fusion of the condition of being loved by y) (n2).

Now we can define a *synchronic fusion* and a *diachronic fusion*:

- synchronic fusion :: "an object b is a “synchronic fusion” of a
     condition iff: both (1) every x that meets the condition is part
     of b; and (2) every part of b overlaps something that meets the
     condition."
- diachronic fusion :: "an object b is a “diachronic fusion” of a
     condition iff: it is always the case that b synchronically fuses
     the condition."

This _will_ get us overlapping thinkers:

> For example, consider the condition of being a sitting cat. Suppose
> that now, b synchronically fuses that condition, and c
> diachronically fuses it. Then: we know that everything that is (now)
> a sitting cat is (now) part of both b and c. We know that (assuming

Diachronic fusions obviously change parts.  But diachronic parts also
clearly lead to co-located objects (even if only temporarily).

Why can't there be always co-located objects:  by stipulation,
apparently

(e1′) ∀x∀y(Always[∀z(z ≤ x ↔ z ≤ y)]→x=y)
(e2′) ∀x∀y(Always[∀z(z ◦ x ↔ z ◦ y)]→x=y)

Diachronic fusions obviously change parts.  But diachronic parts also
clearly lead to co-located objects (even if only temporarily).

**** Confused
Is 'condition' used to refer to the _condition_ or the the objects
satisfying the condition in a phrase like "no non-empty condition has
two distinct diachronic fusions"?
*** Coincident objects
**** Bennett, "Coincidence and the grounding problem"
***** 1. the grounding problem
The question: what grounds the different 'sortalish' properties of
coincident objects (like the statue and the lump)?  Given that they
are composed of the same things, _why_ do they have different
properties?

Sortalish properties are:

1. persistence conditions, particularly modal properties like _being
   essentially shaped about like so,_
2. kind or sortal properties, and
3. properties that things have partially in virtue of their
   instantiation of properties in categories 1 or 2 (341).

So, "in light of the fact that spatio-temporally coincident things
have all of their other properties in common, in virtue of what do
they have the sortalish properties they do?  I think that the
multi-thinger has to answer, 'in virtue of nothing at all'.  I think
she has to claim that sortalish properties are primitive" (341--342).
***** 2. determination by non-sortalish properties
Can the different sortalist properties be 'grounded' in non-sortalish
properties?

No:

> Goliath's non-sortalish properties do not suffice for its sortalish
> properties for the simple reason that Lumpl has just the same
> non-sortalish properties but does not have the same sortalish ones
> (343).
***** 3. concepts and conventions
Can the different sortalish properties be grounded in our conventions?

Something like "in each place where non-sortalish properties N are
instantiated, there is a thing x with sortalish properties S1 and
another thing y with sortalish properties S2" (348)

But what initially instantiates these properties N?  If there is some
object, then it is something with _no_ sortalish properties, which is
weird.  If there is no object, then there are properties just
'floating about' unattached to an object.  Which is weird.

Additionally, this position requires claiming that it is a conceptual
truth that "where properties N are instantiated..."  And "it is
neither part of my concept of a lump of clay nor of my concept of a
statue that wherever such and such non-sortalish properties are
instantiated, there is a thing that would survive a squashing as well
as a thing that would not" (350).

(Is Bennett right here?)
***** 4. how to be a primitivist
Are the distribution of sortalish properties brute facts?

> the claim that it is primitive that Goliath is essentially shaped
> that way is compatible with the claim that it is in fact shaped that
> way in virtue of its low-level microstructural properties, and the
> claim that it is primitive that I am essentially human is compatible
> with the claim that I am in fact human in virtue of my genetic
> structure and evolutionary history (354).

The explosion:

> every region of spacetime that contains an object at all contains a
> distinct object for every possible way of distributing 'essential'
> and 'accidental' over the non-sortalish properties actually
> instantiated there (354).

"_all the modal bases_ are covered" (355).

The dilemma:

> The only live options, then, are to be either a one-thinger or a
> bazillion-thinger.  We must either think that there is only one
> thing per spatio-temporal location, or else that there are lots and

*** Nihilism
**** "Skepticism and nihilism"
520--521: "And so far as I can discern, there is no sorites which will
work directly to refute the idea that some _entities_ exist."

543: "For my own part, I often now believe that there really are no
tables or rocks, and never so firmly believe that there are such
things as I once did. So, the detailed reflections that now threaten
claims to knowledge, and thus to reasonable belief, threaten even our
mere beliefs themselves."

544: "Now, it must of course be admitted that these arguments
undermine the possibility of any endeavor I should try to propose, or
even the putative thought that I should propose anything, just as all
of my putative essay is undermined.  But even so, I shall
(incoherently) propose that what we have now to do is invent new
expressions which are not inconsistent ones, and by means of which we
may, to some significant extent, think coherently about concrete
reality." 
# <<incoherent>>

**** "There are no ordinary things"
> Human experience, it may be said, naturally leads us to have a
  certain view of reality (117)

And yet Unger has no explanation for why this is.

117: "while I shall argue that our concept of a stone, for example, is
devoid of application, I shall not make any such claim for our concept
of a physical object, or for any similarly general idea. So far as
these present arguments go, then, there may well be various physical
objects, indeed, even of a great variety of shapes and sizes. But
whatever the shapes and sizes of any such objects, none will ever be a
table, a stone, or any ordinary thing."

> In its original form, the sorites argument appears to have concerned
  how many items, say beans, or grains of sand, or even some of each,
  will be sufficient to constitute a heap.  None or one is
  insufficient.  But, if there isn't any heap before us, adding a
  single grain or bean, it seems, will not produce a heap.  Hence,
  even with a million beans quite nicely arranged, there will be no
  heap of them.  By generalization, this is a compelling argument that
  there are no heaps, and that our concept of heap is relevantly
  _incoherent_ (118, my emphasis).

Is it incoherent because there is are no sufficient conditions for its
application (that do not mention heaps)?

> Even from the early grades, we are given some simple scientific
  learning which in broad outline, and with fatal incoherence, is
  this: our ordinary things, like stones, which most certainly exist,
  comprise or consist of many atoms, and even many more sub-atomic
  particles.  The point here has little to do with any niceties of
  such a term as 'consist', but may be put this way: in any situation
  where there are no atoms, or no particles, there are in fact none of
  our ordinary things.  This should move us to deny, with proper
  reasoning, the existence of all alleged ordinary things (120).

See Sider's note about the tensions of science and 'common sense'.

125--126: against 'epistemicist' replies
Note that he explicitly appeals to _concepts_, not things:

> Does anyone imagine that our concept of a swizzle stick
  discriminates at the required atomic level?  Surely, this is quite
  absurd.  But, then, it is just as absurd in the case of tables, and
  of stones (126).

This seems quite true, of course; our concept of 'swizzle stick' or
'chair' does not discriminate at the atomic level.  Nor does it
discriminate at the molecular, or even 'speck of dust' level.  The
_concept_ of chair is completely undetermined in regards to precise
boundaries.

> While Eubulides' contribution has often been labeled 'the sorites
  paradox', there is nothing here which is a paradox in any
  philosophically important sense.  I remarked on this near the
  outset; I hope I have supported it by now.  Accepting our negative
  conclusions here does not mean important logical trouble for us; we
  only think we have troubles while we refuse to admit their validity
  (145).

Except that we _do_ believe there to be chairs.  That we believe there
to be chairs does not entail that there _are_ chairs, of course, but
it does quite enough to generate the paradoxical situation.

# <<ancient>>
> ...What we have done is to disclose contradictions in our beliefs.
  Beliefs about atoms, to be sure, do not have an ancient claim to
  being part of common sense.  But they now seem to be part of it, at
  least in advanced cultures.  And, further, our arguments may be
  conducted wholly in terms of removing, and adding, tiny chips or
  specks.  The premises concerning these visible items would surely be
  part of common sense, albeit reflective or implicit common sense.
  This would be true even of rather ancient times, and even rather
  primitive cultures.  The most rational way of responding to the
  contradictions, I submit, is to deny application for the ordinary
  concepts: the concepts of stones, tables, feathers and sousaphones
  (145).

It is clear that the problem is _not_ due to the conflicting semantic
rules of 'ordinary terms' like 'chair' and 'scientific terms' like
'atom'.  The sorites paradoxes emerged in ancient Greek thought,
before atoms had a clearly defined technical use.  And in any case, as
Unger says, we can run the argument with no reference to atoms or
molecules at all.  Just take a table and sandpaper; scrape the bottom
of one leg (or more), and repeat.

> One way to _misunderstand_ our arguments is to take them as
concerning _words but not things_.  For while our arguments do concern
words they likewise concern things (which are not words).  It is true
that we have shown that, in a relevant manner, terms for ordinary
things are incoherent.  In that that is so, those terms cannot apply
to anything real.  And from that it follows that there are no such
ordinary things as those words might purport to designate.
Accordingly, our results concern words and things alike.  They thus
differ from points of grammatical distinction which concern only
words, and thus our points are more comprehensive.  But they are also
thus more comprehensive than points pertaining _only_ to things and
not to words, if such points there be; for our points concern things
and something else besides, namely, words (147).

"certain kinds are never instanced"~\cite[147]{unger1979}.

> Concerning words and kinds, now, we might say this.  First, we might
say that it is in connection with _semantics_ that our reasonings have
what are their most obvious implications and, second, that their most
obvious semantic implications concern certain _sortal nouns_, namely,
those which purport to denote ordinary things.  Thus, it appears quite
obvious to us now that there will be no application to things for such
nouns as 'stone' and 'rock', 'twig' and 'log', 'planet' and 'sun',
'mountain' and 'lake', 'sweater' and 'cardigan', 'telescope' and
'microscope', and so on, and so forth.  Simple positive sentences
containing these terms will never, given their current meanings,
express *anything true, correct, accurate, etc., or even anything
which is anywhere close to being any of those things* (148, my
emphasis). [148]

I can't think of any argument against something this flagrantly
false.  How has Unger come to this conclusion?  Is he supposing that a
term may only be correctly applied if there are fully determinate
rules of application?  It may be that he is adhering to the _governing
view_ discussed by Wright.  [[wright][More on this]].

149: "What we have said about words pertains immediately to our
_thought_, for much of our thought is in terms of such words. For
example, when we are under the impression that we are thinking about
an object in the world, I suggest that our impression is mistaken. If
we suppose that we are thinking of Venus and, thus, are thinking of
some existing thing, I suggest that we are similarly in error. At
best, we are thinking of something, but only in much the way we do
when thinking of a fictional entity. Alternatively, it might be that
we are here not really thinking of or about any (finite) entity at
all."

Then how do we communicate?

151: "First, in that we have foregone arguments with regard to living
things, we may still believe in plants and animals, and the organs,
tissues and cells presumed to pertain thereof. In that we may regard
them as mere products of living things, twigs and logs and fingernails
may be considered and denied by us, but perhaps that is a loss which
may be accepted with equanimity."

They cannot be considered if they cannot be thought of.

**** "Elimitivism and the challenge from folk belief"
***** The problem
> Why do the folk believe that there are statues?  If eliminativists
  are right, they have never seen a statue (for there are none).  They
  do sometimes see statuewise arrangements of atoms; but, if
  eliminativists are right, there is no necessary or a priori
  entailment from the existence of atoms arranged statuewise to the
  existence of statues.  Indeed, the arguments for eliminativism
  purport to show that it is impossible for there to be statues.  But
  the folk surely do not confidently believe in statues for no reason
  whatsoever.  What, then, could possibly explain why the folk find it
  at all reasonable to believe in them?  Call this _the problem of
  reasonableness_ (243).

Claiming that people's beliefs about what objects exist are very
unreliable would mean that the _nihilists_ are probably wrong too.

> All false beliefs of otherwise intelligent people stand in need of
  explanation.  Understood in this way, even opponents of
  eliminativism should be able to explain why some reasonable and
  intelligent philosophers believe that there are no statues.  But
  here the explanation is straightforward: these philosophers have
  been moved by powerful arguments that there are no statues.  Most
  false folk beliefs admit of equally straightforward explanation.
  What is special about the mistakes alleged by eliminativists and
  other revisionary metaphysicians is that it is exceptionally
  difficult to provide any satisfactory explanation of their
  reasonableness (245).

Analogy with statues: one's visual evidence would be the same whether

Would it?  Is there a sense in which we see the atoms _as a chair_

**** "Things and their parts"
***** 0. intro
Two different ways of being a part: timeless or temporary
***** 1. timeless part
Criticism of the standard account

How is is that slices of bread and a piece of ham are part of a
sandwich?  Classical mereology would suggest that the sandwich is
simply the sum of the three things.  But the problem with this
suggestion is that, according to classical mereology, the sum of
(three) things exists whenever those things exist:

> Thus the sum $a + b + c +$ . . . will exist whenever any of its
> components $a, b, c,$ . . . exists (just as it is located, at any
> time, wherever any of its components are located).  It follows that,
> under the proposed analysis of the ham sandwich, it will exist as
> soon as the piece of ham or either slice of bread exists.  Yet
> surely this is not so.  Surely the ham sandwich will not exist until
> the ham is actually placed between the two slices of bread.  After
> all, one makes a ham sandwich; and to make something is to bring
> into existence something that formerly did not exist (62).

One could try 'restricting' the parts to the times at which we say the
sandwhich exists.  It would thus be in an extended sense of 'part'
that we say 'the ham is part of the sandwich', because it is only the
'restriction' of the ham that is part of the sandwich. But two
problems:

1. Strictly speaking, the ham isn't part of the sandwich.
2. 'Monsters' like the Cleopatra-ham are also part of the sandwich in
   the extended sense.

He suggests that a necessary component of the sandwich is a manner of
assembly: "in addition to the slices of bread and piece of ham, the
sandwich should contain a trope or particularized relation of
betweenness (or assembly)" (63).  But classical mereology does not
have the resources to manage tropes; they are not parts in the same
way that the bread and ham are.
***** 2. temporal part
Classical mereology can be adapted to give an account of temporal
part:

> Given that my car and its carburetor currently exist, there will be
> a time-slice, or temporal restriction, of each of them to the
> current time. Armed with this notion of time-slice, we may say that
> the carburetor is currently a part of my car if the current
> time-slice of the carburetor is a timeless part of the current
> time-slice of the car. More generally, given any two objects x and y
> that exist at a given time t, we may say that x is a part of y at t
> if the time-slice of x at t is a timeless part of the time-slice of
> y at t (or, in symbols, x ≤t y = df xt ≤ yt) (64).

But the 'monsters' problem arises again:

> Consider the aggregate of the current time-slice of the carburetor
> with Cleopatra or, if you like, with all things whatever that do not
> currently exist. The current time-slice of this monster aggregate is
> the same as the current time-slice of the carburetor. Given that the
> carburetor is currently part of the car, it follows, on the present
> account, then the monster is as well. But surely this is absurd
> (64).

Does this assume four-dimensionalism?  If it does, we can drop the
assumption and still have an objection to temporal parts (cf. van
Inwagen).
***** 3. rigid embodiment
Fine's timeless parthood

> I should like to suggest that we take the bold step of recognizing a
> new kind of whole. Given objects a, b, c, . . . and given a relation
> R that may hold or fail to hold of those objects at any given time,

Unlike the 'classical solution', the relation R is not part of the
bunch in the same way as the flowers are.  It modifies or 'arranged'
the flowers.

- existence :: The rigid embodiment $a,b,c, ... ⁄R$ exists at a time t
               iff $R$ holds of a, b, c, ... at t (66).
- location :: If the rigid embodiment e = a,b,c,... ⁄R exists at time
              t, then e is located at the point p at t iff at least
              one of a, b, c, . . . is located at p.
- identity :: The rigid embodiments a,b,c,... ⁄R and a′,b′,c′,... ⁄R′
              are the same iff the state of a, b, c, . . . standing in
              the relation R is the same as the state of a′, b′, c′,
              . . . standing in the relation R′.
- part-whole 1 :: The objects a, b, c, . . . are (timeless) parts of
                  a, b, c, . . . ⁄R.
- part-whole 2 :: The relation R is a (timeless) part of a, b, c,
                  . . . ⁄R. In this case, the relation R itself is
                  taken to be a (constitutive) aspect of the
                  corresponding rigid embodiment (67).
- part-whole 3 :: Any timeless part of a,b,c,... ⁄R is a (timeless)
                  part of one of a,b,c,... (or of R).

Character postulates (cf. 'character conditions' in "Toward a theory
of part"):

> The character postulates state what descriptive properties a rigid
> embodiment will have---whether, for example, it is red or heavy or
> much admired. What these postulates are will depend upon the
> properties and the sort of rigid embodiment in question.

So whatever relation applies to sandwiches (call it 'B'), the sandwich
is therefore a, b, c /B.  The bread and ham are timeless parts of the
sandwich, but the sandwich only exists when B applies to the parts.

There is still something odd about B being _part_ of the sandwich (but
I think "Toward a theory of part" might solve that).

There is also something odd about 'qua-objects':

> An especially important class of cases are those in which the
> principle of embodiment is a property P rather than a polyadic
> relation R.  The rigid embodiment is then of the form “a/P” and may
> be read as “a qua P” or as “a under the description P.”  An airline
> passenger, for example, is not the same as the person who is the
> passenger since, in counting the passengers who pass through an
> airport on a given weekend, we may legitimately count the same
> person several times (67--68).

What is the difference?  'Being bunched' is also a property, but one
that applies to a group or set of flowers.  One could also perhaps say
that I stand in the relation of 'passengership' to a time.

I think this is ultimately irrelevant because Fine's 'composition
operators' can account for both 'relations' and 'properties' by
reference to the different conditions (in "Toward a theory of part").
***** 4. variable embodiment
How do things change parts over time?

In the case of a river, there are the various molecules of water and
impurities, but there is also _the water_, the 'variable' quantity:

> I take it that the water in the river in the second sense---what we
> may call the variable water---is now constituted by one quantity of
> water and now by another. But what is the variable water (68)?

> I would like to take the bold step of supposing that there is here a
> hitherto unrecognized method by which wholes may be formed from
> parts. In the case of the variable water, there is a function, or
> “principle,” that determines which quantity of water constitutes the
> variable water at any given time.

More co-location, of course.  The variable water is another thing,
riding on top of the water molecules.  And similarly for other
changing things:

> In general, we will suppose, given any suitable function or
> principle F (taking times to things), that there is a corresponding
> object standing in the same relationship to F as the variable water
> of the river stands to its principle.  We call this object the
> _variable embodiment_ of F and designate it by ⁄F⁄ (69).

Fine's 'conceptual container' analogue:

> Here is one way of getting an intuitive grip on the notion of a
> variable embodiment. Imagine a container into and out of which water
> flows. We may then distinguish between three things: (a) the
> container itself, (b) the water that is in it at any given time, and

> container-cum-content being the variable embodiment /F/.

Combining timeless and temporary parthood allows us to account for the
car:

> embodiment. I would like to suggest that at each time at which a

???
****** Postulates
- existence :: The variable embodiment f = /F/ exists at time t iff it
               has a manifestation at t.
- location :: If the variable embodiment f = /F/ exists at t, then its
              location is that of its manifestation ft (assuming that ft has a location).
- identity :: The variable embodiments /F/ and /G/ are the same iff
              their principles F and G are the same.
- temporary part 1 :: Any manifestation of a variable embodiment at a
     given time is a temporary part of the variable embodiment at that
     time (in symbols: ft ≤ t f ).
- temporary part 2 :: If a is a timeless part of b that exists at t
     and if b is a part of c at t, then a is a part of c at t.
- temporary part 3 :: If a is a part of b at t and if b is a timeless
     part of an object c that exists at t, then a is a part of c at t.
- temporary part 4 :: If a is a temporary part of b at t, then there
     is a mereological chain at t connecting a to b.
***** 5. consequences
1. The first is that the majority of material objects, on our account,
   will submit to a hierarchical division into parts.
2. A second consequence of our account is that there will be an
   intensional or conceptual element to the identity of many material
   objects. For a rigid embodiment a, b, c, . . . /R is to be
   understood partly in terms of its material components, but also
   partly in terms of its relational principle R; and a variable
   embodiment /F/ is to be understood wholly in terms of its
   functional principle F. Thus these principles, which are
   intensional or conceptual in nature, are directly implicated in the
   identity of the embodiments and hence also in the identity of the
   material things that are explained by their means (73).
3. A third consequence of our theory---at least under its most
   plausible development---is that there will be many more material
   objects than is commonly supposed. We are familiar with the
   prodigious ontology of the mereologists, according to which any
   occupied region of space-time, no matter how scattered or
   gerrymandered, will determine a material object. But this is
   nothing compared to the ontology of the present view.
   - "Of course, this is not to say that there need be any ultimate
     commitment to these objects. But I would wish to maintain that
     the objects we ordinarily recognize---chairs and tables and the
     like---are not ontologically privileged."

*** SEP Entry
The paradox arises because in the story as told the following eight
claims each seem to be true, but they are mutually inconsistent.

  1. There are several distinct sets of water droplets sk such that
     for each such set, it is not clear whether the water droplets in
     sk form a cloud.

  2. There is a cloud in the sky.

  3. There is at most one cloud in the sky.

  4. For each set sk, there is an object ok that the water droplets in
     sk compose.

  5. If the water droplets in si compose oi, and the objects in sj
     compose oj, and the sets si and sk are not identical, then the
     objects oi and oj are not identical.

  6. If oi is a cloud in the sky, and oj is a cloud in the sky, and oi
     is not identical with oj, then there are two clouds in the sky.

  7. If any of these sets si are such that its members compose a
     cloud, then for any other set sj, if its members compose an
     object oj, then oj is a cloud.

  8. Any cloud is composed of a set of water droplets.

**** 7.1 Argument from Duplication

D1. If all the water droplets not in sk did not exist, then ok would
be a cloud.

D2. Whether ok is a cloud does not depend on whether things distinct
from it exist.

C. ok is a cloud.

D2 implies that being a cloud is an intrinsic property. The idea is
that by changing the world outside the cloud, we do not change whether
or not it is a cloud. There is, however, little reason to believe this
is true. And given that it leads to a rather implausible conclusion,
that there are millions of clouds where we think there is one, some
reason to believe it is false. We can argue directly for the same
conclusion. Assume many more water droplets coalesce around our
original cloud. There is still one cloud in the sky, but it
determinately includes more water droplets than the original
cloud. The fusion of those water droplets exist, and we may assume
that they did not change their intrinsic properties, but they are now
a part of a cloud, rather than a cloud. Even if something looks like a
cloud, smells like a cloud and rains like a cloud, it need not be a
cloud, it may only be a part of a cloud.

area, there are millions of these things. Insofar as I find the latter
of these alternatives rather absurd, I am that far inclined to the

414: "if anything is a cloud, it must be a _natural_ item, with a
real, objective place in nature all its own, so to say."

- What does this _mean_? (And what does it imply about cloud-seeding?)

> If we allow our common-sense *belief* [my emph], that there is _at

Is it also part of the _meaning_ of cloud that there is just one
"right there"?

> In this reality, which in all relevant regard is the _actual_
  reality, i.e., really is reality, there is no natural break, or
  boundary, or stopping place, for any would-be cloud have (415).

> No matter where we start, the complex first chosen has nothing
  objectively in its favor to make it a better candidate for cloudhood
  than so many of its overlappers are.  Putting the matter somewhat
  personally, each one's claim to be a cloud is just as good, no
  better and no worse, than each of the many others.  And, by all
  odds, each complex has _at least_ as good a claim as any still
  further real entity in the situation.  So, either _all_ of _them_
  make it or else _nothing_ does; in this real situation, either there
  are many clouds or else there really are no clouds at all.

"minimum requirements [for] cloudhood" (416).  What does _this_ mean?
(Further talk of marginal, middling, typical clouds.  See also 421.)

420--424: minute boundary differences: aren't they all clouds?

# But presumably a cloud is a concentration of moisture in the
# air. The boundary is where moisture is at the average level for air
# in that region.

cf. stones 435

420--421: Looking at the boundary of a cloud, "we may find, side by
side, or themselves overlapping, a great many potential boundaries for
clouds...if our alleged typical item [the cloud] is indeed a typical
cloud, then many of these candidates, millions at least, do not fail
to be clouds altogether but are clouds of some sort."

> We think of certain things as _concrete_ and of others as, perhaps
  more or less, _abstract_.  When a concrete thing is an _ordinary_
  kind of _spatial_ entity, as in the case of a table or stone, it
  must have a boundary.  Consider, in contrast, certain "more
  abstract" entities, which have their being rooted, so to say, in
  particular concrete entities.  Thus a _swarm of bees_ is somewhat
  abstract, the bees being thought of as concrete.  It is somewhat
  difficult to think of the swarm as having a boundary: Does the swarm
  really include as a part a certain (part of the) space that
  separates the bees? ...  _Insofar_ as we _can_ think of clouds as
  _concrete_, our boundaries for them seem to have a firmer footing
  (431).
**** Vague objects (433)
> what can it be for a stone to be constituted of molecules but of no
  number of molecules?  And although in any real situation _we_ may
  have only a _vague idea_ as to what is the number, in any given
  stone, what kind of number can it possibly be if not some particular
  number?  No, either the stone, that presumedly real, typical
  specimen, is composed of a definite number of molecules, whatever
  the number may happen to be, or _else_ it really is _not_ composed
  of molecules at _all_.

Even if we could establish that there _is_ no fact of the matter as to
how many molecules are in the chair, we're still faced with the
boundary problem.  Unger will say that the chair must have some
boundary (there must be an edge to the chair); if we agree to this,
then we've got arbitrary boundaries (fuzzy or not) and the problem of
the many re-emerges.

So it might be that the only way out here is to deny that there's any
fact of the matter as to where the boundary itself is.  But if that
does not also require denying that there _is_ a boundary (does it?),
we're faced with some interesting questions:

1. If there is a boundary, but there is no fact of the matter as to
   where it is, Unger might reply: "Well, then, do you have any idea
   where the boundary _might_ be?  It's not five miles east.  It's
   probably somewhere near where we expect it to be.  But if we can
   agree that it's within a relatively small region, we've already
   made it somewhat determinate.  Why can't we zoom in a bit?  At this
   point things are only a matter of degree."
   - It's true that we can rule out the boundary's being five miles
     away (or 1 mile, or 20 feet).  But I don't think that means we
     have to keep making precisifications until we have an 'exact'
     boundary.  ('Chair' just doesn't work like that.)  
   - We might even draw a distinction between 'boundary' (or 'edge')
     in the ordinary sense and 'molecular' or 'atomic' boundary, and
     maintain that while there is no fact of the matter as to where
     the atomic boundary of the chair is, there is a perfectly clear
     edge to the chair.  Where?  "Here" (pointing or touching the edge
     of the chair).
2. If someone asks "How many molecules (or atoms) are in this chair?"
   or "How many molecules (or atoms) compose this chair?" what is our
   answer?  For presumably there is no number we can give.
   - We could just say "I don't know", which is perfectly true.
   - We could say "Well, I can tell you its mass and weight."
3. If she asks "Where does the chair end?" we point, again, at the
   edge of the chair.
4. Probably she will try to get us to agree that a given molecule in
   the middle of the chair is definitely part of the chair, then
   slowly move outward and eventually force us to admit that there is
   a point at which the molecules are no longer definitely part of the
   chair (and so force us to draw a precise boundary).  It seems clear
   that---on the assumption that there _are_ molecules in the
   chair---some molecules are _definitely_ part of the chair.  And if
   it is supposed to be vague or indeterminate where the boundary of
   the chair is, then it is plausible that some molecules are _not_
   definitely, nor definitely not, part of the chair.  So at what
   point do molecules stop being definitely part of the chair?
   - This is a common (and important) objection, but there is a
     troubling aspect to it.  Our objector first tries to get us to
     agree that a _particular_ molecule or atom is definitely part of
     the chair.  She is not merely trying to establish that _some_
     molecule or atom is definitely part of the chair.  That finding
     is not problematic for us.  Some molecules are definitely part of
     the chair, some aren't.  What she needs to do is pick out an
     actual molecule and get us to agree that _that_ molecule is part
     of the chair.
   - How might she go about doing this?  She can't just point and say,
     "Is _that_ molecule part of the chair?"  _What_ molecule?  Simple
     demonstrative expressions can't pick out one particular molecule
     from among thousands.  For her demonstration to succeed, I would
     have to recognize which molecule she meant to refer to.  This
     obviously cannot succeed---first, how could _she_ have in mind a
     particular molecule, and second, how on earth could _I_ know
     which one she has in mind?
     - Could she use a microscope?  If she zoomed in on the edge of
       the chair, then it would probably be indeterminate whether
       _any_ of those molecules were part of the chair.  So she would
       have to somehow get an image of a molecule _inside_ the wood of
       the chair.
     - This would be an easier task with a more transparent object
       like a human.  But even with a chair, she could make a
       cross-section and ask "_was_ this molecule definitely part of
       the chair?"

(Of course, none of this talk of cross-sections applies to clouds.
But there is a _practical_ difficulty for the boundary-drawer here.
If we are standing in the middle of a cloud, she can of course trap
some water in a container and ask "was the water in here (definitely)
part of the cloud?"  If we say "yes", then she will want to move
gradually outward until we are not willing to say that the water is
definitely part of the cloud.  But because of the nature of clouds,
she will not be able to do this.  Clouds are constantly in flux, so it
is practially impossible to move, molecule by molecule, from the
center to the edge.)
***** Levels of organization
<<levels>>
Above I tried to develop two kinds of boundary.  The 'ordinary'
boundary or edge is that which we pick out when we point or touch the
edge of the chair and say "this is the edge of the chair".  The
'molecular boundary' is what I wanted to say was somehow
indeterminate.

This might suggest that we organize reality in a stratified way.
Certain aspects of our thought and talk operate at a certain level,
and other aspects apply to other levels.  For example, 'chair' might
be part of our 'object-level' representation of reality, while
'molecules', 'wood cells', and other such things apply to the
'microscopic' or 'chemical' or 'scientific' level.  One might then
claim that one simply _cannot_ analyze ordinary-level concepts like
'chair' in terms of chemical notions like 'molecule' or 'atom'.  There
is some kind of incompatibility between terms from these different
levels that give rise to the ontological confusion we have been
grappling with.

This is a compelling notion, and I think it is behind H. G. Wells'
essay ([[Wells]], also HPMOR 28).  But there are obvious problems.

First it seems rather too much like Carnap's frameworks.  The idea
that there are isolated regions of talk that have their own rules is
at least a little strange.  It is more intuitively plausible that we
are not constantly shifting back and forth between different languages
or 'linguistic frameworks', but are simply speaking English the whole
time.  However, it is also true that we can at least roughly
categorize certain terms as 'technical' or otherwise, and so recognize
that they are generally used for certain purposes.  One might then go
on to suppose that as a result of this, their _meaning_ changes to
reflect this particular purpose.  (In Wittgensteinian terms, 'atom'
and 'molecule' are part of the chemical and scentific language-games.)
Because certain words are more prevalent in certain domains, it should
not be surprising that their meanings adapt to the contexts in which
they are most used, and do not seamlessly integrate into other kinds
of talk.  For example, 'atom' is just not _built_ to work with
'chair'.

But it seems obvious that there is some cross-cultural transmission.
Chairs are (let us suppose) made of wood; wood is made up of cells,
which are made up of molecules, which are made of atoms, etc.  Each of
these adjacent relationships seem perfectly unobjectioble.  It is only
when we compare the things at each end (chairs and atoms) that our
problems arise.  For as we seem to have found, chairs can't be
described in terms of atoms; there is no fixed relationship between a
chair and any determinate number of atoms.

What's going on?  It seems that perhaps whatever relationship we have
observed between the adjacent things (chairs and wood, wood and cells)
is _non-transitive_ (see [[wright][Wright]] on this).

Perhaps the 'made of' relation we thought we observed between each
pair is in fact a different relation in each case.  Or perhaps there
is no coherent relation at all.
***** Different worlds
# <<worlds>>
I say above that chairs can't be described in terms of atoms.  There
are a couple of ways to understand this.

First, if it is in fact true that there is no determinate number of
atoms in any given chair, or any determinate border, _then_ of course
we can't describe a chair in terms of the atoms that (apparently) make
it up.  There is no determinate relationship between the chair and any
number of atoms.

Second, the proposition "there are five chairs in the basement" is not
equivalent to any proposition that replaces 'chair' with some
description of the positions of atoms.  This may be because there is
no fact of the matter as to which (and how many) atoms are in the
chair (as above), but there is a separate issue.  Even if there were
determinate borders and one could list off each atom composing each of
the five chairs, there would be nothing in this atomic description
that would indicate that the things being described are _chairs_.  Nor
would there be anything to indicate that the five different clusters
of atoms are five of the _same thing_.  This is because there are no
necessary and sufficient conditions for chair-hood, especially not in
terms of atoms.

We might think that there is support for the 'worlds theory' in
statements made by people like Eddington:

> Recall Eddington’s (1928) claim that because of the mismatch between
  our ordinary conception of a solid table and the scientific fact
  that matter is largely empty space, the ordinary table has no place
  within scientific reality (Sider, "Against parthood", 11).

The idea would be that terms like 'chair' got their meaning prior to
the widespread acknowledgement of scientific theory.  But as Unger
correctly (!) points out, the sorites paradoxes that originally gave
rise to these issues were posed long before the relevant advances in
physics.  The paradox does not need atoms; miniscule bits of matter
will do just fine.  See Unger on [[ancient][this]].

(A side note: I think Sider misunderstands the consequences of
Eddington's claim.  If 'scientific reality' is understood to be
reality as described by science (physics), then _of course_ the
ordinary table has no place there.  Neither does the Sun, for that
matter (see Stroud).  But this does _not_ mean bthat tables do not
exist.)
*** Unger again
453: we should have to assume that, very often, many stupid little
children are somehow made to get things right, as to the small number
of nearby real clouds or stones, by the operation of some
imperceptible, perhaps ineffable, and certainly quite mysterious
factor."

456: "if there are millions of "overlapping stones" before me...how am
I to think of a single one of them, while not then equally thinking of
so many others, with each of which "it" might so easily be confused?"

"I suggest that up until now, at least, not one of us has ever really
thought of any existing stone or table or human hand."

458: "If I have never thought individually of any stone, or any other
common object, then it seems doubtful, to put it mildly, that I have
ever thought of any such things collectively either. Accordingly, it
may well be that I have never _thought of_ any stones at all, or
tables, or even human hands. If that is so, then it would seem that _a
fortiori_ I do not _know_ anything _about these entities_, however
commonly I might otherwise suppose.

** Austin

re: the phenomenalist notion of sense-data

10: "it is also implied, even taken for granted, that there is *room*
for doubt and suspicion, whether or not the plain man feels any. The
quotation from Locke, with which most people are said to agree, in
fact contains a strong *suggestio falsi*. It suggests that when, for
instance, I look at a chair a few yards in front of me in broad
daylight, my view is that I have (*only*) as much certainty as I need
and can get that there is a chair and that I see it. But in fact the
plain man would regard doubt in such a case, not as far-fetched or
overrefined or somehow unpractical, but as plain *nonsense*; he would
say, quite correctly, 'Well, if that's not seeing a real chair then *I
don't know what is*."'

11--12: "it is important to remember that talk of deception only
*makes sense* against a background of general non-deception. (You
can't fool all of the people all of the time.) It must be possible to
*recognize* a case of deception by checking the odd case against more
normal ones. If I say, 'Our petrol-gauge sometimes deceives us', I am
understood: though usually what it indicates squares with what we have
in the tank, sometimes it doesn't---it sometimes points to two gallons
when the tank turns out to be empty. But suppose I say, 'Our crystal
ball sometimes deceives us': this is puzzling, because really we
haven't the least idea what the 'normal' case---*not* being deceived
by our crystal ball---would actually be."

# <<deception>>
([[planets][Wittgenstein]]: denying the existence of something (e.g., a planet)
involves a claim about what _does_ exist)

14: "when the plain man sees on the stage the Headless Woman, what he
sees (and this *is* what he sees, whether he knows it or not) is not
something 'unreal' or 'immaterial', but a woman against a dark
background with her head in a black bag. If the trick is well done, he
doesn't (because it's deliberately made very difficult for him)
properly size up what he sees, or see *what* it is; but to say this is
far from concluding that he sees something *else*."

22--25: distinguishing illusions and delusions

> [Ayer's "argument from illusion" has] two clear implications---(*a*)
that all the cases cited in the argument are cases of *illusions*; and
(*b*) that *illusion* and *delusion* are the same thing. But both of
these implications, of course, are quite wrong; and it is by no means
unimportant to point this out, for, as we shall see, the argument
trades on confusion at just this point.

> The most important differences here are that the term 'an illusion'
(in a perceptual context) does not suggest that something totally
unreal is *conjured up*---on the contrary, there just is the
arrangement of lines and arrows on the page, the woman on the stage
with her head in a black bag, the rotating wheels; whereas the term
'delusion' *does* suggest something totally unreal, not really there
at all.

> Why is it that we tend---if we do---to confuse illusions with
delusions? Well, partly, no doubt the terms are often used
loosely. But there is also the point that people may have, without
making this explicit, different views or theories about the facts of
some cases. Take the case of seeing a ghost, for example. It is not
generally known, or agreed, what seeing ghosts *is*. Some people think
of seeing ghosts as a case of something being conjured up, perhaps by
the disordered nervous system of the victim; so in their view seeing
ghosts is a case of delusion. But other people have the idea that what
is called seeing ghosts is a case of being taken in by shadows,
perhaps, or reflections, or a trick of the light---that is, they
assimilate the case in their minds to illusion. In this way, seeing
ghosts, for example, may come to be labelled sometimes as 'delusion',
sometimes as 'illusion'; and it may not be noticed that it makes a
difference which label we use.

> [Ayer] said earlier, as explicitly as could be, that there is a
  'correct and familiar' usage of 'perceive' which is such that 'to
  say of an object that it is perceived does not entail saying that it
  exists _in any sense at all_'.  On this there is no possible comment
  except that there _isn't_.[^ghosts]

[^ghosts]: What about seeing ghosts?  Well, if I say that cousin
Josephine once saw a ghost, even if I go on to say that I don't
'believe in' ghosts, whatever that means, I can't say that ghosts
don't exist _in any sense at all_.  For there was, in _some_ sense,
this ghost that Josephine saw.  If I do want to insist that ghosts
don't exist _in any sense at all_, I can't afford to admit that people
ever see them---I shall have to say that they think they do, that they
seem to see them, or what not. (95)

> in exceptional circumstances ordinary forms of words may be used
  without being _meant_ in quite the ordinary way; our saying of the
  D.T.'s sufferer that he 'sees pink rats' is a further instance of
  this, since we don't mean here (as would be meant in an ordinary
  situation) that there are real, live pink rats which he sees; but
  such stretchings of ordinary words in exeptional situations
  certainly do not constitute special _senses_, still less 'correct
  and familiar' senses, of the words in question. (97)

> The situation in which I would properly be said to have _evidence_
  for the statement that some animal is a pig is that, for example, in
  which the beast itself is not actually on view, but I can see plenty
  of pig-like marks on the ground outside its retreat.  If I find a
  few buckets of pig-foot, that's a bit more evidence, and the noises
  and the smell may provide more evidence still.  But if the animal
  then emerges and stands there plainly in view, there is no longer
  any question of collecting evidence; its coming into view doesn't
  provide me with more _evidence_ that it's a pig, I can now just
  _see_ that it is, the question is settled. (115)

> If, for instance, you tell me there's a telephone in the next room,
  and, (feeling mistrustful) I decide to verify this, how could it be
  thought _impossible_ for me to do this?  I go into the next room,
  and certainly there's something there that looks exactly like a
  telephone.  But is it a case perhaps of _trompe l'oeil_ painting?  I
  can soon settle that.  Is it just a dummy perhaps, not connected up
  and with no proper works?  Well, I can take it to pieces a bit and
  find out, or actually use it to ring somebody up---and perhaps get
  them to ring me up too, just to make sure.  And of course, if I do
  all these things, I _do_ make sure; what more could possibly be
  required?  This object has already stood up to amply enough tests to
  establish that it really is a telephone; and it isn't just that, for
  everyday or practical or ordinary purposes, enough is _as good as_ a
  telephone; what meets all these tests just _is_ a telephone, no
  doubt about it.

# <<entailment>>
Most words for 'ordinary things' are like this---we don't learn an
'analytic' definition, then go about the world looking for things that
fit the definition.  Rather, we learn words like 'chair' by asking
"what's that?" and being told "that's a chair".  Unger's claim that
'chair' and similar terms for ordinary things "have no application"
because he assumes there ought to be an 'analytic definition' of such
things; something like "x is a chair iff such-and-such".  On any
criteria like this, if it is true that something (some x) is a chair,
then certain "statements" are entailed by the truth of "x is a
chair"---namely, those statements on the right side of the
biconditional.  But Austin's point is that terms like 'pig' (and
'chair') do _not_ have these sorts of entailments.  There is _no_ true
biconditional of the form "x is a pig (chair, etc.) iff p".  Unger's
argument that our ordinary terms have no application is successful
only if he is correct in assuming that such terms must have "analytic
definitions" of the biconditional form.  But what motivates this
assumption? (see [[analyticity]])

> It is not, as Warnock's language suggests, that we can stop hedging
  around if there is a good case for coming right out with it; the
  fact is that we don't _begin_ to hedge unless there is some
  special reason for doing so, something a bit strange and off-colour
  about the particular situation (142).

** Intentional identity
[[file:intentional.text][10 November draft]]

*** Old Notes
# Geach, "Intentional identity"

627: "a number of archers may all point their arrows at one actual target, a deer or a man (real identity); but we may also be able to verify that they are all pointing their arrows the same way, regardless of finding out whether there is any shootable object at the point where the lines of fire meet (intentional identity). We have intentional identity when a number of people, or one person on different occasions, have attitudes with a common focus, whether or not there actually is something at that focus."
>What are they each pointing at?
>>Well, who 'saw' the 'deer'?
>He's pointing at what he takes to be a deer; what is he really pointing at? (nothing?)
>>What are the others pointing at?
>"Whatever he's pointing at." (i.e., nothing)

627: "(3) Hob thinks a witch has blighted Bob's mare, and Nob wonders whether she (the same witch) killed Cob's sow."

630: "First, it might be suggested that 'she' in (3) ought not to be glossed as 'the same witch', but should rather be regarded as an anaphoric substitute (what I have called a pronoun of laziness) to avoid repetitious language; (3) would then be a substitute for something like this:

(18) Hob thinks a witch has blighted Bob's mare, and Hob wonders
whether the witch who blighted Bob's mare killed Cob's sow.

This suggestion is easily dismissed: for our reporter might be justified in asserting (3) if he had heard Hob say 'The witch has blighted Bob's mare' and heard Nob say 'Maybe the witch killed Cob's sow', even if Hob had not thought or said anything about Cob's sow nor Nob about Bob's mare."

>Why would the reporter not be justified in asserting (18) in the same situation?
>>re: substitutions and implicit intentionality
>what is wrong with: "Nob wonders whether: (1) a witch blighted Hob's mare, and (2) the witch who blighted Hob's mare killed Nob's sow."?
>>or if we want Geach's use of 'assumptions': "Nob assumes/thinks that a witch blighted Hob's mare, and wonders whether the witch who blighted Hob's mare killed his (Nob's) sow"?

Sentences (19)--(23)
??????????

631: "We very often take ourselves to know, when we hear the discourse of others, that they are meaning to refer to some one person or thing---and that, without ourselves being able to identify this person or thing, without our even being certain that there really is such a person or thing to identify. What we are claiming to know in such cases---let alone, whether the claim is justified---must remain obscure so long as intentional identity is obscure."

632: "Now is it in truth necessary, if Hob and Nob are to mean to refer to the same person as "the witch," that they should both have some one definite description actually in mind, or even, one producible from each of them by a suitable technique of questioning? This appears to me to stand or fall with the corresponding theory, held by Russell and by Frege (cf. his article "Der Gedanke"), that any ordinary proper name is used equivocally if it does not go proxy for some one definite description; and in spite of these great names, such a theory seems to me extremely ill-founded and implausible."

>Call the witch 'Sue'. (designation by description: "Sue is the witch that actually blighted Hob's mare, if any such witch there be." or "Let 'Sue' refer to that witch, if it exists, that blighted Hob's mare.")
>>Were there such a witch, then we could say _of_ the witch (Sue) that it might have been the case that Sue didn't blight Hob's mare. But Sue (=the witch that actually blighted Hob's mare) does not exist, so there is no question of what could have happened in counterfactual scenarios involving her.
>Thus: "Hob thinks that Sue blighted his mare, and Nob thinks that Sue killed his sow."

# Dennett, "Geach on Intentional Identity"

337: "So long as we hold out the hope or conviction that the object or person or witch under discussion exists, questions of identity are substantive and serious, but as soon as we become skeptics like our reporter, and disavow transparent renderings of our discussion, questions of identity and diversity become idle if not outright meaningless. Suppose Tom says he doubts the existence of a solid gold round square; I cannot reply coherently that I doubt the existence of another solid gold round square---not Tom's at all."

"Whenever we wish to disavow belief in the actual existence of any intentional objects, 'same' can at best mean "exactly similar in characteristics." Suppose tribe A believes in a moon god X, and tribe B believes in a moon god Y. How similar must the biographies and traits of X and Y be before we, as nonbelievers, will say the tribes believe in numerically the same moon god?"

>Each tribe believes that there is some god such that they both do (or do not) believe in it.
>>We, of course, know that there is no god for them to believe in. If we say that they believe in the same god, then all we can be taken to mean is that they each believe that there is a god and believe that the other tribe believes that there is the god that they believe there to be.

"Are all the world's Santa Clauses and Father Christmases, black-skinned and white, in sleighs and on horses, really the same nonexistent man? What exotic fact would be affirmed by a man who asserted this, and how would we settle a dispute? Or suppose Tom and Mary believe in qualitatively identical anthropomorphic Gods, except that Tom thinks God has blue eyes and Mary thinks God's eyes are brown. Do they believe in the same God? If so, then either the God they believe in has contradictory characteristics (and neither of them, we can suppose, believes in a God with contradictory characteristics), or we shall have to tell one of them that he is wrong about the color of the eyes of the God he believes in!"

>If they take each other to be thinking of the same god, then they will take themselves to be disagreeing. We, who know that there is no god, recognize that neither of them are thinking about any god (they aren't thinking of anything at all), and so their dispute is nonsensical.

338: "(A) Hob thinks a witch has blighted Bob's mare, and Nob wonders whether the witch Hob thinks blighted Bob's mare killed Cob's sow."

340: '"22) can be analyzed as
(C) Nob assumes that just one witch blighted Bob's mare, and Nob wonders whether (the following is the case:) just one witch is such that Nob assumes it to have blighted Bob's mare, and she killed Cob's sow"

# Edelberg, "A new puzzle of intentional identity"

1--2: *EXAMPLE 1*. Last night, Bob's mare became quite ill. Hob, who tends Bob's barn, inferred that a witch blighted her. This morning Hob said to his friend, Nob, "A witch blighted Bob's mare."
Nob believes what Hob has told him. He thinks for a moment, and says, "Cob's sow died early this morning. I'll bet the same witch killed the sow, too." But in fact both animals fell ill due to perfectly natural causes.

2: *EXAMPLE 2*. The Gotham City newspapers have reported that a witch, referred to as "Samantha", has been on quite a rampage. According to the article she has been blighting farm animals and crops and throwing people down wells. In reality, there is no such person: the animals and crops all died of natural causes, and the people found at the well-bottoms had all stumbled in by accident in a drunken stupor. The news reporters simply assumed that a witch was responsible for all the mishaps, and dubbed her "Samantha". Hob and Nob both read the Gotham Star and, like most folks, they believe the stories about the witch. Hob thinks Samantha must have blighted Bob's mare, which took ill yesterday. Nob thinks Samantha killed his friend Cob's sow. (For purposes of later discussion, we assume Nob has no beliefs at all about Hob or about Bob's mare; he is unaware of the existence of either.)

>Hob thinks that Samantha (=the witch blighting farm animals and crops and throwing people down wells) blighted his mare, and Nob believes that Samantha (=[...]) killed his cow."

8: *EXAMPLE 3*. Joan decides to play a trick on Fred. She tells him that she has bought him a brand new Cadillac Coup de Ville, and that it is waiting for him in George's garage. In fact she has done no such thing, but Fred believes her. Purely by coincidence, Mabel decides to play the same trick on Charlie. She tells him a brand new Cadillac is waiting for him in George's garage. He believes her, but the garage is empty.

>9: Intuitively, de dicto (15) could easily be false in the example, but de dicto (16) is true (on a Russellian analysis of the definite descriptions).
(15) Fred believes a new car belongs to him, and Charlie believes it is a Cadillac.
(16) Fred believes the new car in George's garage belongs to him, and Charlie believes the new car in George's garage is a Cadillac.
On the theory we are considering, however, (16) is a substitution instance of (15). So (15) could be false while one of its substitution instances is true. Obviously something is wrong.

>>(15) implies that (a) Charlie is aware of Fred's belief or (b) the speaker believes that the car exists (cf. Dennett 337 and "Speakers' beliefs" below). To capture this, we would construe (16) as (16'): "Fred believes that a new car in George's garage belongs to him, and Charlie believes that the car that Fred believes belongs to Fred is a Cadillac."
>>OR: "Charlie believes that: 'the new car in George's garage belongs to Charlie' and Fred believes that: 'the new car in Georges garage belongs to Fred'."

9--10: EXAMPLE 4. Pat lives in Chicago, Ruth lives in Pittsburgh. Neither knows of the other's existence. In reality, neither Ruth nor Pat is married, but each believes herself to be married to someone. In both cases, there is no real person whom they believe to be their husband; the "husbands" are utter fantasy. Coincidentally, each woman believe her husband to be named "David Boswell".
Here, (17) could easily be false; but (18), on one of its uses, is true.
(17) Pat believes someone lives in Chicago, and Ruth believes he lives in Pittsburgh.
(18) Pat believes David Boswell lives in Chicago, and Ruth believes David Boswell lives in Pittsburgh.
If the set of admissible substituends contains names that are homonymous in the way that 'David Boswell' is in the example, and the semantical rule for quantification makes no provision for this, then a false intentional identity statement like (17) could have true substitution instances." Neither of these two requirements are met if we take ordinary proper names as the set of admissible substituends.

>???
>>"Pat believes that someone named 'David Boswell' lives in Chicago, and Ruth---------\&c."


## Speakers' beliefs and intentions

I am the reporter. Hob says to me, "A witch blighted my mare. You don't believe me? Go talk to Nob. He'll tell you something." Nob says to me, "The witch that blighted Hob's mare? She killed my sow."

If I say "Hob says that a witch blighted his mare and Nob says that she killed his sow", this can be taken several ways. If my audience thinks that I believe in witches and/or believe what I have been told, then they may understand me to be saying that there is some witch who is suspected of blighting a mare and killing a sow. If I make it clear that I am skeptical of the whole scenario, then my readers will interpret me as using a "pronoun of laziness"; what they will take me to be saying is something like

>Hob thinks that a witch blighted his mare, and thinks that the witch that blighted his mare killed Nob's sow; Nob thinks that a witch killed his sow, and thinks that the witch that killed his sow blighted Hob's mare; and Hob and Nob believe that there is exactly one witch that blighted Hob's mare and killed Nob's sow. [plus something about common knowledge?]

A skeptical report of belief in the "same god" or "same witch" amounts to a report that two or more people believe (falsely) that there is some god or witch, _and take each other to believe that there is the witch that they believe there to be_. There is no need to appeal to exactly similar characteristics; otherwise religious disputes over the nature of god would be sillier than they already are.

How do we report EXAMPLE 2? We would _not_ say "Hob says that a witch blighted his mare and Nob says that she killed his sow"; rather we would say "Hob says that Samantha blighted his mare and Nob says that she killed his sow." Here, if our readers are gullible (and take us to be so too), they will understand us to be saying that _Samantha_, the witch herself, has done these two terrible things. If the readers are skeptical (and think us so too), they will read it as "Hob thinks that Samantha (=the [imagined] witch who has been doing such-and-such) blighted his mare, and Nob thinks that Samantha (=the [imagined] witch...) killed his sow."

** Virtual objects

*** James van Cleve

**** Problems from Kant

# Chapter 1

## Section C ("Appearances and Things in Themselves")

'ing'-'ed' ambiguity (7)

> We should construe him [Kant] as saying that appearances are
representeds that have no being apart from the representing of them.

> Things in themselves, by contrast, are things that exist
independently of human representation or cognition. They exist whether
perceived or no and have whatever properties they do independently of
us.

## Section D ("Virtual Objects")

Third way? (8)

> I recommend an interpretation of Kantian appearances that is
different from the one-world view and from the two-worlds view in its
traditional form...appearances...are *virtual objects*...to say that a
(9) virtual object of a certain sort (e.g., a patch of red) exists is
shorthand for saying that a certain kind of representation occurs.

> If Kantian appearances are virtual objects, then to say that someone
is aware of an appearance of a certain sort is only to say that he is
sensing or intuiting in a certain way.

Comparison with two-world and intentional objects models (10)

> an appearance cannot exist unperceived for the same reason that a
waltz cannot exist undanced: in either case, for the "object" of the
act to exist *is* for the act to take place in a certain way.

* Language and Reference

** Meaning Skepticism
*** Reference magnetism
Sider attempts to use Lewis' notion of 'naturalness' to solve meaning
skepticism.

> The problem is one in metasemantics. How do words (or thoughts---but
  let's stick to words) get their meanings? What "semantic glue"
  attaches them to the world?  Philosophers differ over the nature of
  the semantic glue, but the problem confronts nearly any such
  view.  The problem is that on nearly any theory of its nature, the
  glue doesn't seem to be sticky enough; it apparently cannot secure
  meaning with sufficient determinacy.  Most roughly put: what I mean
  by 'pig' is surely determined by such facts as that I've always said
  'pig' when in the presence of pigs; but why do such facts determine
  that by 'pig' I mean pigs, rather than
  pigs-I've-encountered-in-the-past, or pigs-in-
  my-immediate-vicinity, or pigs-before-2010AD-or-cows-afterwards or
  ...? (22)

Suppose I say "Did you hear, Donna's bought a pig?"  What determines
that by 'pig' I mean pig?  My unreflective reply is that that is what
the _word_ means, and I gave no indication, and so gave my listener no
reason to believe, that I meant it otherwise.  When we use a word to
mean something other than what it is generally used to mean, we must
make this intention clear---otherwise our non-literal communication
fails.

But of course, the skeptic can ask "what fact determines that the
_word_ 'pig' means pig (the animal)?"  Here, if we say, 'well, the
fact that we use 'pig' to refer to pigs', then the trap is sprung.
"Ah, but you have only ever referred to pigs before 2015, or
pigs-on-earth, etc."

Is the problem then one only of designation and not (speaker)
reference?  For if I refer you to the pig Donna bought by saying,
"Donna's new pig is big", then our referential communication succeeds
iff you think of the pig as a result of recognizing my referential
intention.  If this all goes through, how can I _not_ have 'meant' the
pig with 'pig'?  (The question of what I mean seems hardly to arise.
What matters is what I am referring to.)

But while the problem might not arise regarding singular reference, it
seems to be present in other modes of talk.  In the original quote
("Donna's bought a pig"), I am not _referring_ to the pig.  I am
merely saying that Donna bought *a* pig.  So the skeptic may ask,
"what do you mean by 'a pig'?"  And we reply 'a member of the set of
pigs!'  (Do 'natural kind terms' *designate* the members of a set?)

> The argument shows that a correct interpretation must do more than
  make specified sentences come out true. What more? Lewis's answer is
  that correct interpretations must, as much as possible, assign
  natural properties and relations (or their extensions) to
  predicates. The meanings under interpretation 1 are (or correspond
  to) at least somewhat natural properties: being a pig, being edible,
  and so on.

> Lewis's constraint on reference is "externalist"; reference is not
  determined merely by us.  We of course do part of the work.  Our
  patterns of use of language determine which sentences go into S.
  But the degree to which an interpretation counts sentences in S as
  being true is just one factor in determining whether that
  interpretation is correct.  The other factor is the naturalness of
  that interpretation's semantic values.  And this second factor has
  nothing to do with us.  Natural properties and relations are
  "intrinsically eligible meanings"; they are "reference
  magnets". (27)

> The crucial assumption of the derivation is that _reference is an
  explanatory relation_. One can explain certain facts by citing what
  words refer to.  But if reference were given by a bizarre
  interpretation then reference-involving "explanations" would not in
  fact be explanatory, since they would be cast in badly
  non-joint-carving terms.  Hence reference is not given by a bizarre
  interpretation.

(Not entirely sure what's going on.)  Semantic 'externalism' only
makes sense to me if the claim that what we mean is not 'up to us' is
taken to mean that language-use is social behavior, and so what _I_
mean by 'pig' is constrained by (public) semantic facts.  To use 'pig'
in a non-literal or derivative way (to refer to a cop as 'that pig'),
my audience needs to recognize my intention to deviate from literal
use.  Even my referential intention to refer my audience to the cop
fails unless my audience can infer what object I intend to refer to.

But the externalism of Sider and Lewis seems like something else.  The
magnetism metaphor is (as Sider recognizes) dangerous, for it does
indeed call to mind the image of our words' getting swept toward rocks
and pigs and other 'magnets'.  This image gives to _nature_ the role
of fixing the designation of our words, which is nonsense.

In any case, does this notion of reference magnetism apply to anything
other than _reference_ (designation)?  Doesn't the problem of meaning
skepticism arise for words like 'and' and 'which'?

> A highly joint-carving interpretation can "trump" the superior
  charity of rival interpretations.  Now, this prediction is in some
  cases correct, especially for "theoretical" terms---terms that are,
  intuitively, intended to stand for joint-carving meanings.  When a
  term like 'mass' is introduced in physics, it's intended to stand
  for a fundamental physical magnitude, and so if there's a
  joint-carving property in the vicinity, even if it doesn't quite fit
  the physicists' theory of 'mass', then that property is meant by
  'mass'. (31)

*No.* When they realize that they were using a bad definition of mass,
 they won't say "Oh, it looks like _we really meant_ x [the better
 definition]."  Rather, they'll say that they _ought to have meant_ x,
 and that if they look back at what they say and _interpret
 themselves_ as meaning x, then what they said fits the data or
 whatever.  But by *re-interpreting* themselves thus, they are not
 _altering the past_: they know perfectly well that they were
 operating under the wrong definition, and so _meant_ to use that
 definition.  Sider seems to be reinforcing the bad magnetism metaphor
 here: somehow, without our intending or knowing it, our words got
 swept away and attached themselves to 'mass'.

> Highly joint-carving candidates don't automatically trump; the
  simplistic theory is too simplistic.  But on the other hand,
  joint-carving isn't completely irrelevant either: the gruesome
  candidates of the semantic skeptic still must be excluded.
  Fortunately, even if we reject the simplistic theory, we can still
  exclude the gruesome candidates simply because they're
  gruesome---simply because they carve so badly at the joints.  For
  reference magnetism, construed as a metametasemantic thesis,
  survives the demise of the simplistic theory.  No reference relation
  connecting us to the gruesome candidates could take part in an
  explanatory theory. (32)

What is his alternative to the 'simplistic theory'?

**** Descriptive fit
There have been a number of apparently related murders in the city
recently.  Each victim is found with all their zippers removed.  Based
on the similarities, the detectives suppose that there is one
individual behind the attacks.  They dub this individual 'Jack the
Zipper':

- Jack the Zipper :: That individual, if such there be, who has killed
     x and y and z and ...

Having made this stipulation, they go on to use the name 'Jack the
Zipper' in their discussions of the crime.  "After the murder, Jack
the Zipper must have left through the window"; "Jack [the Zipper]
lives somewhere in Sussex"; "Jack appears to operate alone".

Now suppose it comes to light that none of the murders were actually
related.  Each was committed by a separate individual acting
independently.  However, there was a single person---named Sue---who
removed all the zippers.  (Sue is a little bit crazy.)

Now suppose that the claims and predictions made using the name "Jack
the Zipper" are largely true of Sue.  Sue left through the window
(after the murder), Sue lives in Sussex, and Sue did indeed work
alone.

Should we say that when the detectives made those claims and
predictions, they were _then_ referring to Sue?  They introduced the
name "Jack the Zipper" so as to talk about a murderer; Sue is not a
murderer.  Moreover, if we demand that referring (someone) to
something requires entertaining singular thoughts about it, then
reference cannot have succeeded here: the detectives were thinking
about nobody in particular, and certainly not Sue.

But now suppose that Sue is hauled in for questioning.  The detectives
want to know how she learned about these murders, why she didn't
notify the authorities, etc.  The detectives look back through their
notes and read "Jack the Zipper" to mean Sue; this gives them a
largely accurate picture of Sue's activities.  But does "Jack the
Zipper" _designate_ Sue?  I don't think so.

Here, then we have a case in which a term ("Jack the Zipper") is
introduced in a way that makes in unclear what object, if any, it
designates.  As a result, when speakers use the term, it is arguable
that they are not referring to anything at all with it.  _Later_, when
it is discovered that there is an 'eligible candidate' for the term,
speakers can use the term to refer to that individual.  But unless the
term is explicitly redefined (as in the case of 'mass'), the term
still does not designate anything.
**** Newton
Is there a parallel with Newton's understanding of mass?  He (and pretty
much everyone before Einstein) took mass to be

- Mass :: Newtonian mass is equal to momentum divided by velocity---in
          this it is unlike proper mass but like relativistic mass.
          But, unlike relativistic mass, Newtonian mass has the same
          value in all reference frames.  Newtonian mass also has some
          properties that distinguish it both from proper mass and
          from relativistic mass: e.g., it is equal to twice the
          kinetic energy divided by $v^2$, and it is conserved in all
          interactions (469).

The problem is that we have at least two conflicting definitions (m/v)
and (2ke/v^2).  We can't simply say that Newton meant one or the other
of these; for instance, affirm that he was intending to refer to
(2*kinetic energy / $v^2$)

Field claims that it is indeterminate which of _these_ concepts
were 'denoted' by Newton's uses of 'mass':

- Relativistic mass :: total energy/$c^2$

- Proper mass :: nonkinetic energy/$c^2$

The reason Field wants Newton to have been referring to either
relativistic mass or proper mass is that if 'Newtonian mass' _denotes
nothing_, then sentences like (7) come out false:

7. To acclerate a body uniformly between any pair of different
velocities, more force is required if the mass of the body is greater.

This is true according to special relativity, so it would be strange
if Newton's expression of this proposition was _false_.  Yet if by
'mass', Newton is taken to mean some nonexistence 'Newtonian mass',
then how can it be true?  It seems that the 'charitable
interpretation' is to take Newton as referring to one or the other of
the newly discovered concepts.  But there is no fact of the matter as
to which one he was referring to.
** _Truth and Meaning_
*** Introduction
**** Translational semantics
Founded in part on the idea that one must give the meaning of a word
or sentence in _some_ language (if one cannot rather point).  These
givings of meanings are therefore assertions of synonymity between
words or sentences (propositions) of two different languages.  (Of
course one could "translate" between English and English, but that
would be silly.)  The 'object language' is the one whose meanings are
given in terms of the 'theory language'.  And there are guidelines:

1.  If S is meaningful and unambiguous, then there is exactly one
    sentence of L onto which S is mapped.
2.  If S is n ways ambiguous, there are n distinct sentences of L onto
    which S is mapped.
3.  If S lacks a meaning, there is no sentence of L onto which S is
    mapped.
4.  If S entails S', there is an effectively decidable relation that
    holds between the sentences of L onto which S and S' are
    respectively mapped.

But the problem for translational semantics is that someone could be
given translations of object sentences (produced with the guidelines
in mind) and yet still not understand the object sentences:

> there is no escaping the fact that one could have a competence thus
  based upon the mapping relation, and yet not know what a single
  sentence of the language meant.  A speaker-hearer would know that
  only if he knew what sentences of the theory's language meant; but
  this is knowledge of precisely the kind that was to be accounted for
  in the first place (ix).

For example, if the object language is French, and our theory language
is English, we might map 'chauve' onto 'bald'.  But knowing that these
words are synonymous does not help someone learn the meaning of
'chauve' unless she already knows the meaning of 'bald'.  So we need
to map 'bald' onto something that she _does_ know the meaning of.
We've gotten nowhere!  ("As only can be expected," will say some
translational semanticists.  "You cannot break out of the circle of
language.")

But Gareth Evans will not be so easily cowed:

> There is a fallacy in the argument [that the limitations of the
  translation theories are inevitable].  Of course, we cannot express
  meanings other than with words [but see below].  But it does not
  follow that if we give the meaning of a sentence, S, by means of a
  sentence S', we must be stating or reporting upon a relation between
  S and S'.  We may give the meaning of S by not mentioning S', but by
  using it, in the standard use which it has in talk about the world
  (ix--x).

Thus the famous "'Snow is white' is true if and only if snow is
white."  The right half of the biconditional is not a sentence given
to be synonymous with the left half's sentence, but is an _expression
in use_.  Evans thinks that by giving meanings with expressions, we
can transcend the limitations of translational semantics:

> A theory which uses expressions to state meanings would be immune to
  the objection which devastates translational semantics, namely that
  someone could know it without understanding the language of which it
  is a theory.  To say, for example, that Pierre knows that something
  satisfies 'chauve' if and only if it is bald is not to credit Pierre
  with knowledge of some relation between 'chauve' and the English
  word 'bald'---knowledge which he could have without knowing what
  either meant.  It is to credit him with knowing a relation between
  'chauve' and bald men: knowledge which would, together with similar
  knowledge, help to explain competent employment of French in talking
  about the world.  We can state the relation that way because the use
  to which we put 'bald' in stating it is the use to which we put
  'bald' in our talk about the world, notably in saying, of various
  people, that they are bald (x).

(more to come, but superficially, it seems as if we still haven't
gotten anywhere.  one cannot understand "something satisfies 'chauve'
iff it is bald" without already understanding what it means to be
bald.  but as Evans emphasizes, the sort of relation instantiated by
the above biconditional is one between words ('chauve') and the world
(bald people).  to know what it means to be bald is to know something
about the world.  thus it seems natural that one would learn
expressions involving 'bald' _by ostention_ ("now _that's_
bald")---and voila! we have broken out of the circle of language.  in
this example, we can only understand (and so use) words if their use
has been _shown_ to us.)
*** Language-mastery and the sorites paradox

**** 1. the governing view
> The governing view, then, is a conjunction of two claims: that our
  use of language is rightly seen, like a game, as a practice in which
  the admissibility of a move is determined by a rule, and that
  general properties of the rules may be discovered by means of the
  sorts of consideration just described [various kinds of conceptual
  analysis].  What I am going to argue is that these theses are
  mutually incoherent (225).

> Vagueness is hardly ever, as Frege and Russell thought, merely a
  reflection of our not having bothered to make a predicate precise.
  Rather, the utility and point of the classifications expressed by
  many vague predicates would be frustrated if their were supplied
  with sharp boundaries ... Lack of sharp boundaries is a phenomenon
  of semantic depth.  It is not usually a matter simply of our lacking
  an instruction where to 'draw the line'; rather the instructions we
  have determine that the line is _not_ to be drawn (227).

**** 2. sorites paradoxes
1. the heap
2. childhood to adulthood in the space of a heartbeat
3. barely discriminable series of color patches

**** 3. observational rules
4. indiscriminable series of color patches; nontransitivity of
   indiscriminability

> ... it is plausible to suppose that any _ostensively definable_
  predicate must be observational.  If an expression can be
  ostensively defined, it must be possible to draw someone's attention
  to features in his experience which warrant its application; and if
  this is possible, there can be no question of the expression
  applying to some but not others among situations which he cannot
  distinguish in experience ... To master the sense of a predicate is,
  at least, to learn to differentiate cases to which it is right to
  apply it from cases of any other sort.  If such mastery can be
  bestowed ostensively, then a comparison of two such cases must
  always reveal a difference which sense-experience can detect.  The
  notion that the whole range of application of a predicate can be
  made intelligible by ostensive means presupposes that it is never
  the case that only one of a pair of objects, which the senses cannot
  tell apart, is characterized by it (235).

**** 4. predicates of degree?
Application of a predicate F may be seen as increasingly _less (or
more) justified_.  But the paradox re-emerges when we ask, "at what
point is the application of F no longer justified _at all_ (or when
'not F' is more justified than 'F')?"

**** 5. eliminate tolerance?
If we stipulated exact boundaries for predicates (e.g., 'red',
'heap'), then we could tell in most cases whether or not a given
specimen fits the new precise predicate.  It would be much like how we
say "That's at least two feet".  We can always appeal to the ruler if
need be, but generally don't need to.  But then if there are two
cases, one in which it's clearly 'safe' to apply the predicate and the
other in which it's nearly as clear, we can get the same sort of
paradox: when ought we to pull out our color-charts?

> The possibility of our dispensing with paradigms for most practical
  purposes depends on our capacity e.g. to distinguish between cases
  where we could tell whether or not 'red' applied just by looking and
  cases where we could not, where we should have recourse to a chart.
  But if we are able to make such a distinction, there can be no
  objection to introducing a predicate to express it.  And then, it
  seems, the semantics of _this_ predicate will have to be
  observational.  On what other basis should we decide whether
  something looks as though comparison with a chart would determine it
  to be red than how it looks?  Of any pair of colour patches which
  look exactly alike, if either looks as though the chart would
  deliver the verdict 'red', both must.  So the new predicate,
  introduced to reflect our capacity to make this distinction, will be
  applicable to both members of any pair or matching colour-samples,
  if to either (243).

**** 6. conclusion
> Agreement is generally possible about how colours are to be
  described; which is equivalent to saying that others _seem_ to use
  colour predicates in a largely consistent way.
>
> It is this fact of which the governing view can provide no account
(245).
** "On the Coherence of Vague Predicates"
# <<coherence>>
*** general notes
Wright lists two incompatible theses that constitute the governing
view:

1. Semantic rules fully determine the correct use of terms.
2. These semantic rules can be uncovered through the analysis of the
   use of the terms.

Rejecting (2) leads to views like epistimicism, wherein the semantic
rules of vague terms like 'bald' are actually fully precise, although
we cannot know exactly where their boundaries are.  I am forced to
agree with Unger that such views are bizarre.

So it is much more tempting to reject (1).  But this raises even more
difficulties.  If we agree (ignoring Unger) that it is possible to use
terms like 'chair' _correctly_, then how can we maintain that there is
no rule that determines which uses are and are not correct?  How can
there be correct and incorrect uses, and how can we know that a given
use is correct or incorrect?
*** the text
**** 1 introduction
> We no longer see the vagueness of ordinary language as a defect.
  But we retain a second-order wraith of the Frege-Russell view in the
  notion that, even if the senses of many expressions in natural
  language are not exact, there is a precise semantical description
  for a given natural language, i.e., a theoretical model of the
  information assimilated in learning a first language or,
  equivalently, of the conceptual equipment in whose possession
  mastery of the language may be held to consist.  Even if 'bald',
  say, is imprecise, this does not require any inexactitude in an
  _account_ of its sense (325--326).

Are we supposed to be able to precisely demarcate the imprecision?
(This may be the goal of supervaluationism.)

> We suppose our use of language to be fundamentally _regular_; we
  picture the learning of language as the acquisition [or] grasp of a
  set of rules for the combination and application of expressions
  (326).

- Drawing irresponsibly upon linguistics, we might draw an analogy.
  The Chomskyan model of language involved the internalization of a
  set of rules, which governed (_governed_) language-use.  But the
  Pierrehumbert model views rules as theoretical _posits_ that
  correspond to nothing in reality.  Human language-use is understood to
  be a process of generalizations over large samples of previous
  language-tokens.  The tokens we have heard most frequently are more
  likely to be referenced with regards to future utterances; rare or
  nonexistence tokens are not repeated.  In this way our language-use
  appears to be rule-governed.
- Something similar _might_ be going on with semantics.  If there is
  really no rule governing the use of 'chair', but if there is
  nonetheless _some_ pattern behind its use, then we might appeal to
  some sort of generalizing behavior.  Based on our past experience,
  in which people point at things and say "chair", we form a _rough
  idea_ of what falls under the term.  When faced with a novel object,
  we take a good look at it and, if resembles those things which in
  the past have been referred to as chairs, then we'll go ahead and
  call it a chair.

# <<explanatory>>
> It is no obstacle to such a conception [that of regular rules] that
  we cannot in general informatively state such rules, i.e., provide a
  statement which could be used to explain the sense of an expression
  to someone previously unfamiliar with it.  Consider, for example,
  the following schematic rule for a one-place predicate, F:

>> F may truly be applied to an individual, a, if and only if a
   satisfies the condition of being $\phi$

> How should we specify $\phi$ if F is 'red'?  Plainly the only such
  condition which actually captures our understanding of 'red', rather
  than, in a merely extensional way, its conditions of application, is
  ... the condition of being red (326).

The key, then, is not explanatoriness but _regularity_.

> Our picture, then, is that to use language correctly is essentially
  nothing other than to use it in conformity with a set of
  instructions, of semantic rules.  Of course our handling of language
  is in general quite automatic, but so is a chess player's
  recognition of the moves allowable for a piece in a certain
  position; it remains true that an account of his knowledge is to be
  given by reference to the rules of chess (327).

> The question now arises, what means are legitimate in the attempt to
  discover features of the _substantial_ rules for expressions in our
  language, the rules which determine specifically the senses of such
  expressions?  The view of the matter with which we are centrally
  concerned in this paper is that we may legitimately approach our use
  of language from within, that is, reflectively as self-conscious
  masters of it, rather than externally, equipped only with
  behavioural notions (327).

> *The governing view*, then, is a conjunction of two theses: that our
   use of language is properly seen, like a game, as an activity in
   which the allowability of a move is determined by [a] rule, and
   that properties of the rules may be discovered by means of the
   sorts of [internal] consideration just described (327).

If the first thesis is false, then _there are no rules to be
discovered_, and so there can be no question of internal inquiry as
to the properties of the rules.

> The sorts of consideration admitted by the second thesis will
  transpire, in the succeeding sections of the paper, to yield support
  for the idea that such predicates are _essentially_ vague...it is
  not generally a matter simply of lacking an instruction where to
  draw the line; rather the instructions we already have determine
  that the line is _not_ to be drawn (330).

> Thus it is that an adherent of the governing view simply has no
  coherent approach to the Frege-Russell view of vagueness.  His
  second thesis requires him to reject the suggestion that vagueness
  is a superficial, eliminable aspect of natural language with no real
  impact upon its informative use.  But it does so by means of
  considerations which require him to regard many vague predicates as
  semantically incoherent, so that, unless the Frege-Russell view is
  right, he cannot maintain his first thesis with respect to such
  expressions.  Only if their vagueness _is_ an incidental feature can
  he maintain that the _essential_ semantics of such expressions
  conform to his first thesis (330--331).

**** 2 (examples)
- Example 1 :: The heap; "in the present semantic situation of 'heap'
               it would be merely an error to insist that, for some
               particular value of n, n+1 grains of salt would amount
               to a heap while n grains would not; for that is simply
               not the sense of 'heap'.  If it were agreed in some
               particular case that n+1 grains did amount to a heap,
               no-one could produce a telling reason for withholding
               the predicate from the same pile minus one grain;
               except perhaps avoidance of the incoherent implicit in
               the situation (332).
- Example 2 :: "Predicates of degree of human maturity---'infant',
               'child', 'adolescent', 'adult', display the same
               peculiarity.  They are mutually inconsistent yet lack
               sharp boundaries with respect to their neighbours in
               the scale of human maturation.  More exactly, if we
               take some sufficiently small interval of time and
               suppose that someone matures in a typical fashion, then
               at no stage will he effect _within_ such an interval of
               time a transition from one stage of maturity to the
               next" (332).
- Example 3 :: Series of _barely_ discriminable color patches.


Each of these concepts/terms have "a certain _tolerance_" (333).

But a supervaluationist treatment might say that this is not so.  She
might say that there _is_ (or will be) some precise boundary; we have
simply not yet decided where that boundary is.  But "if we avail
ourselves of the types of consideration afforded by the governing
view, we shall reject this suggestion as a deep misapprehension of the
nature of this species of vagueness.  The lack of sharp boundaries
possessed by these examples is correctly interpreted as tolerance,
provided that we may so discover elements of their senses" (335).

> The utility of 'heap', the memorability of the conditions under
  which something is red, the point of 'child' thus appear to impose
  upon the semantics of these predicates tolerance with respect to
  marginal change in their various relevant respects (337).

> ...the manner in which we typically use these expressions needs some
  other model than the simple following of rules, if these are to
  incorporate all the features of their senses which we should wish to
  recognise (338).

**** 3 series of indiscriminable color patches
- Example 4 :: an apparently smooth transition from red to orange


Example 4 appears to indicate that "predicates of strictly
observational sense" are rendered incoherent by the governing view.
What kinds of predicates are these, and must they be 'strictly
observational'?

> It might be supposed that any _ostensively definable_ predicate must
  be observational.  If an expression can be ostensively defined, it
  must be possible to draw to someone's attention those features in
  his experience which warrant its application; and if this is
  possible there can be no question of the expression applying to some
  but not others among situations which he cannot distinguish
  experientially...

> Unless it is disallowed that aspects of the semantics of an
  expression can be discovered by appeal to such considerations, we
  are bound to regard this situations as basically correct.
  Accordingly, we can no longer combine the conventional idea of the
  place which ostensively defined predicates occupy in our 'conceptual
  scheme'---the base of the epistemic pyramid---with the view that
  strict semantic coherence is a necessary condition of
  intelligibility.  Rather, we have to recognise that such predicates
  are endowed by their very mode of introduction with a kind of
  original sin---a species-liability to tolerance (341--342).

> To master the sense of a predicate is, at least, to learn to
  differentiate cases to which it is right to apply it from cases of
  any other sort.  If such mastery can be bestowed ostensively, a
  comparison of two such cases must always reveal a difference which
  sense-experience can detect.  The notion, then, that the whole range
  of application of a predicate can be made intelligible by ostensive
  means, presupposes that it is never the case that only one of a pair
  of objects, which the senses cannot tell apart, is characterised by
  it (342).

> Absolutely any ostensively defined predicate may come to display
  tolerance, for absolutely anything which it characterises might
  undergo seemingly continuous change to a point where it could be so
  characterised no longer (347).

> This conclusion rests upon two premisses which might be held open to
  question: that it is right to regard the senses of colour
  predicates, etc., as purely observational; and that this is a very
  fundamental fact about their senses, whose sacrifice would be
  possible only at great cost.  For the first no further argument will
  be provided in this paper.  The considerations adduced earlier in

If we developed charts and definitions so that 'red', 'heap' etc. were
tolerance-free, we would not have to carry charts and bean-counters
around with us any more than we currently have to carry rulers around
in order to use terms like '5 inches long'.  But

  If we are able to make such a distinction, what objection can there
  be to introducing a predicate to express it?  But then, it seems,
  the semantics of this predicate will have to be observational (359).

  It is, to begin with, unclear how far our use of e.g. the vocabulary
  of colours _is_ consistent.  The descriptions given of awkward cases
  may vary from occasion to occasion.  Besides that, the notion of
  using a predicate consistently would appear to require some
  objective criteria for variation in relevant respects among items to
  be described in terms of it; but what is distinctive about
  observational predicates is exactly the lack of such criteria.  So
  it would be unwise to lean too heavily, as though it were a matter
  of hard fact, upon the consistency of our employment of colour
  predicates.  What, however, may be depended upon is that our use of
  these predicates is largely _successful_; the expectations which we
  form on the basis of others' ascriptions of colour are not usually
  disappointed.  Agreement is generally possible about how colours are
  to be described; and this, of course, is equivalent to saying that
  others _seem_ to use colour predicates in a largely consistent way
  (361).

  _some_ more restricted account of the epistemology of semantic rules
  is required than that afforded by the governing view (364).

** Competence
# <<competence>>
Intelligent adult speakers of English know how to use terms for
ordinary things, such as 'chair', 'table', 'pig', etc.  What does this
amount to?  Leaving aside problems related to truth, we can at least
say that speakers and listeners can use such terms, and judge whether
others use such terms, correctly.  There may or may not be _rules_
that determine the correctness or incorrectness of a given use of a
term, but it seems clear enought that a term like 'chair' can be used
correctly or incorrectly.

Recognizing this establishes nothing.  That we sometimes use 'chair'
correctly does not show that we ever use 'chair' to refer to chairs,
or that there are any chairs at all.  It must be next established that
the fact that we know how to use 'chair' (correctly) somehow entails
that there are (or at least have been) chairs.

Doing this is not entirely straightforward.  It seems obvious that
there are some terms that we know how to use (correctly), but that do
not designate an existing group of things.  For example, there are no
witches, but there is a sense in which we know how to use the term
'witch'.  For example, the term is correctly applied to the Wicked
Witch of the West, but incorrectly applied to Santa Claus.  The former
fictional character is a (fictional) witch, while Santa Claus is not a
witch, fictional or otherwise.  We also can use the term non-literally
but correctly, when referring to (say) Michelle Bachmann.  There are
also incorrect non-literal uses of 'witch' and its relatives, such as
when someone refers to a legitimate legal inquiry as a 'witch-hunt'.

The fact that we have this competence with 'witch' by no means entails
that there are (or ever have been witches).  So why should we suppose
that things are ever different with 'chair'?

One apparent difference is that certain correct and literal uses of
'chair' are _demonstrative_ uses.  For example, some uses of "this
chair" or "that chair" are correct or appropriate, whereas others are
not.  If I say "this is a fine chair" or "sit in that chair" and there
is nothing remotely like a chair anywhere in sight, then I have
evidently made some sort of mistake.  Such expressions are generally
only used correctly (and literally) when there is (or appears to be) a
chair, or something like a chair, in the area demonstrated.

By contrast, there do not seem to be any correct and literal uses of
'witch' that are demonstrative in this way.  We can of course point to
a drawing or painting and say correctly "that is a witch", but this is
plausibly interpreted as non-literal speech.  Either it involves some
suppressed element ("that is a [picture of a] witch") or it ought to
be prefixed with a 'fictional' operator ("fictionally: that is a
witch").  When we call people 'witches', similar non-literality
applies.  The term is presumably used to draw attention to certain
unattractive characteristics, such as cruelty, ugliness, etc.  But if
a witch is supposed to be an individual (generally female) that has
magical powers or is associated with 'occult' practices or rituals,
then there has never been a correct expression involving "that is a
witch" in which 'witch' is used literally.

If we can establish that terms like 'chair', 'table', 'pig', and those
for other ordinary things are often used _correctly_ in demonstrative
expressions, then there is a justifiable temptation to go on to say
that expressions that are often taken to have 'ontological import',
such as "there is a chair" are not only correct but _true_.  If we
feel confident that such an expression is correct, what would prevent
it being also true?  Remember that it is correct when used
_literally_; there is no question of the expression not being true
because it is supposed to be used in a non-literal context.

If a nihilistic philosopher claims that such expressions are false,
then she will have a task explaining why they nevertheless are
correct.  If she denies that they are correct, then we may, I hope,
ignore her.

If the nihilist appeals to some conception of loose truth, then (as I
have argued) she will have to explain _why_ the expression is loosely
true (what's its loose-truthmaker or whatever).  I don't think she
will have a good time of it.
** Semantic localism

** Referring to the many
When we refer to "that chair", it is _undecided_, for every thing
(atom), whether or not that is 'part of' the chair.  So when Unger (or
whoever is playing the sorites game) asks us "is _that_ atom part of
the chair?" we _then_ decide whether or not.
