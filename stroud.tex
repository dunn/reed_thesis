A nihilistic metaphysical thesis should be accompanied by an
explanation of why people nonetheless believe that there are chairs
and other ordinary things.  Peter van Inwagen and Trenton Merricks
each have the beginnings of such an explanation.  The explanation
offered by van Inwagen is flawed, but Merricks has a more promising
strategy.  I expand on what I take to be Merricks explanation of why
we believe that there are chairs, and conclude that it is successful,
given one other assumption.  That assumption is the denial of
metaphysical universalism.  However, universalism is independently
plausible, and {\em its} unintuitive consequences can be
satisfactorily explained using Merricks' own strategy.

\section{Explaining the beliefs of others}
\label{intro-beliefs}
\noindent Many people have false beliefs.  These beliefs misrepresent
how the world is.  For example, some people believe that ghosts exist.
These people each hold a false belief, for it is not true that ghosts
exist.  There are no ghosts in the world.  Despite this fact---that
there are no ghosts---some people believe that there are.  Why?  What
explanation can we give as to why someone believes a falsehood like
this?

In explaining why someone holds a belief, we appeal to {\em reasons}.
Even people who hold beliefs that we may consider irrational (like the
belief that there are ghosts) have reasons for holding these beliefs.
They may not be good reasons; someone might believe that there are
ghosts because her older sister told her that there are ghosts, or
because she read ghost stories as a child and took them seriously.
Someone who believes in ghosts might even think that she has {\em
  seen} a ghost.  This too would be a false belief; there are no
ghosts, so nobody can have seen one.  But here too there will be a
reason why she holds this false belief.  Perhaps she saw a strange
play of light on a distant wall, or the reflection of the moon
filtered through an attic window.  What she actually saw was perhaps
one of these things, but she somehow took what she saw to be a ghost.
Probably she already believed that there were ghosts, and so, when
confronted with a deceptive or confusing sight, was predisposed to
form the mistaken belief that she was seeing a ghost.

Here and in what follows, when I say that there is a reason why
someone believes something, I mean that there is some {\em cause} that
produced the belief.  Above, I told a causal story about why the
person who believes that she saw a ghost holds that belief.  She had
been told that there were ghosts by a person who she thought
trustworthy, so she came to believe that there are ghosts.  Holding
that belief caused her to be predisposed to interpret unusual
phenomena as ghosts.  This disposition caused her to believe that she
was seeing a ghost when she saw a reflection of the moon.

My use of the word `reason', therefore, should be taken in this causal
sense.  There are other ways that people use the word `reason'.  If
someone asks ``What reason do you have to believe that $((P
\rightarrow Q ) \wedge P) \rightarrow Q$?''  I might reply that it is
a theorem of first-order logic.  Here I am not telling a causal story.
I am rather {\em justifying} my belief that $((P \rightarrow Q )
\wedge P) \rightarrow Q$.  But in this case it is perfectly correct to
say that I am giving a reason as to why I hold a belief.  It is just
not a {\em causal} reason.  A causal reason would be something like
the following: $((P \rightarrow Q ) \wedge P) \rightarrow Q$ is true,
and I have done the proof.

(Another example: suppose someone falsely believes that $((P
\rightarrow Q ) \wedge Q) \rightarrow P$ is a theorem of first-order
logic.  There will be some (causal) reason why they hold this belief;
probably they attempted to deduce it from no premises and believe that
they succeeded.  There will, in turn, be a reason why they hold {\em
  this} false belief; maybe they were not concentrating on the proof
steps, or they forgot certain rules of deduction.)

An example involving an obviously true belief might help clarify the
distinction between causal reason and justifying reasons.  If someone
were to ask me why I believe that the sky is blue during the day, my
answer would be ``because it is!''  There's not much else I can say to
{\em justify} my belief.  But this not a {\em causal} explanation.
The fact that something is true (the sky {\em is} blue) does not cause
me to believe it.  Otherwise I would believe every truth, and I do
not.  There are doubtless many truths that I do not believe.  There
must therefore be another (causal) reason why I believe that the sky
is blue, other than the fact that the sky is blue.

I believe that the sky is blue because, first, it is blue, and second,
I have {\em seen} that it is blue.  My vision is generally reliable
(or at least seems to be), so the fact that my eyes ``tell'' me
something is good reason to believe it.  The same is true of my other
senses: they are generally reliable, so the fact that they ``tell'' me
something is a good reason to believe it.  It does not follow that it
is {\em true}, however (though no doubt we believe that it is true);
our eyes can be deceived.

A skeptic might claim that we cannot rule out the possibility that we
are {\em constantly} deceived.  They attempt to undermine the
reliability of our senses.  I will not be addressing such arguments.
Rather, in what follows I will examine arguments that deny (or appear
to deny) that many of our beliefs about ordinary things are true.  The
philosophers making these denials do not claim that our eyes are
unreliable sources of information.  Their arguments are metaphysical
rather than epistemic; they deny that certain objects are {\em
  possible}.

For example, Trenton Merricks believes that chairs do not exist.  He
relies on a number of metaphysical arguments to motivate this claim.
If he is right, however, then it seems to follow from this that
beliefs like ``there are chairs'' are necessarily false.  I, however,
believe that there are chairs.  Even if Merricks is right, and my
belief is (necessarily) false, there are reasons why I believe this.

If someone were to ask me why I believe that there are chairs, I would
probably answer ``because there are, and I have seen them (and sat
upon them)!''  It seems obviously true, just like the fact that the
sky is blue.  I have seen lots of chairs, and I can't have been
confused or deceived {\em every} time.

Nonetheless, Trenton Merricks, Peter van Inwagen and other
philosophers say that I am mistaken.  They claim that I have not in
fact seen lots of chairs, though I believe that I have.  There are
several different arguments by which nihilists seek to establish that
chairs (and other ``ordinary things'') do not exist; we will examine
some of these arguments below.  Having made these arguments, however,
the nihilists must reject our causal explanation of why we believe
that there are chairs.  Our explanation was that there are chairs and
we can see them.  But the nihilist denies that there are chairs, and
so should admit that, if we believe that there are chairs, there must
be a different explanation as to why we hold this belief.

\subsection{Paraphrasing beliefs}
\label{paraphrase}
Trenton Merricks denies that chairs exist, and claims that, if we
believe that chairs exist, we are mistaken.  His task will be to
explain why we form these false beliefs.  But not all nihilistic
philosophers deny that we are, in fact, mistaken.  They deny that
there are any chairs, but maintain that beliefs like the following
might still be true:

\begin{itemize}
  \item There are two chairs in the next room.
  \item I own some very nice 17th-century chairs.
  \item Some chairs are heavier than some tables.
\end{itemize}

Peter van Inwagen is one of these philosophers.  He denies the
existence of tables, chairs, apples, and all other inanimate composite
objects (van Inwagen's technical definition of `composite' will be
discussed below in Sections \ref{scq} and \ref{tech}).  He allows that
the sort of propositions listed above may be true, but insists that
this does not mean that there are chairs (or tables):
\begin{squote}
I want to do what I can to disown a certain apparently almost
irresistible characterization of my view, or of that part of my view
that pertains to inanimate objects.  Many philosophers, in
conversation and correspondence, have insisted, despite repeated
protests on my part, on describing my position in words like these:
``Van Inwagen says that tables are not real''; ``\,\ldots not true
objects''; ``\,\ldots not actually {\em things}''; ``\,\ldots not
substances''; ``\,\ldots not unified wholes''; ``\,\ldots nothing more
than collections of particles.''  These are words that darken counsel.
They are, in fact, perfectly meaningless.  My position vis-\`{a}-vis
tables and other inanimate objects is simply that there {\em are}
none~(\citeyear[99]{inwagen1995}).
\end{squote}

Van Inwagen asserts, quite seriously, that ``there are no tables or
chairs or any other visible objects except living organisms''
(\citeyear[1]{inwagen1995}).  But van Inwagen cannot deny that we at
least {\em believe} that there are chairs.  He admits that many of us
hold beliefs that we would express as ``there are two chairs in the
next room'' or ``I bought a new chair today''.  Indeed, he admits that
such beliefs are often {\em true}: ``when people say things in the
ordinary business of life by uttering sentences that start `There are
chairs\,\ldots ' or `There are stars\,\ldots ', they very often say
things that are literally true'' (\citeyear[102]{inwagen1995}).

Van Inwagen, when denying that we have beliefs about chairs, appears
to maintain that the beliefs that we (erroneously) take to be about
chairs are not, in fact, beliefs about chairs.  If a belief expressed
as ``that is a fine chair'' was actually about a chair, then it could
only be true if there was at least one chair (and a fine one).  But
van Inwagen denies that there is at least one chair, but nonetheless
says that such a belief might be true.  He accordingly recognizes the
need to explain what our beliefs really are about.  If he explains
what the {\em content} of our beliefs is, then he will also be able to
explain {\em why} we hold such beliefs.
