%\section{How to defy common sense}
%\label{denials}
\noindent Every so often a philosopher will claim that some aspect of what we take to be our world is somehow illusory, bogus, or simply nonexistent. This sort of denial will take various forms. One might claim that a certain phenomenon does indeed find expression in the world, but that it is somehow subjective; without humans to experience it, there would be no such phenomena. Or one might deny that some ordinary object of experience is actually non-existent. Peter van Inwagen claims that tables do not exist. He recognizes, of course, that people talk and have beliefs about (what they take to be) tables, so he must find a way to explain our beliefs in tables in terms of those things that he does believe to exist. Finally, one might claim that some things are non-existent, and that we in fact {\em don't} really talk and have beliefs about them. This is the sort of denial we make of the existence of ghosts. Unlike the philosopher who denies the existence of tables, we who deny the existence of ghosts don't have to explain people's beliefs in ghosts---people simply don't {\em have} coherent beliefs about them, because they are entirely unreal. Few philosophers make denials of this sort about ``real or significant'' things, because such things (tables, chairs, people, custard) are the putative objects of many beliefs, and to say that these beliefs are utterly incoherent is to cross the line into nonsense.%\footnote{A line Peter Unger has never been shy about crossing, as we will see below.}

In this section I will briefly look at each of these types of denial and how the philosophers making them manage to explain the beliefs that people have about the objects of the denials.

\section{The relegation}
\label{relegate}
Among the various phenomena we observe in the world, it can be tempting to draw a distinction between those that we somehow imprint upon the world and those that are independent of any human experience. The former are `subjective' while the latter are `objective' or absolute:
\begin{squote}
Whatever is due only to us and to our own ways of responding to and interacting with the world does not reflect or correspond to anything present in the world as it is independently of us. The aim of an ``absolute'' conception, then, is to form a description of the way the world is, not just independently of its being believed to be that way, but independently, too, of all the ways in which it happens to present itself to us human beings from our particular standpoint within it\,\ldots\,[So we] form some conception of that independent reality and come to understand parts or aspects of our original conception of the world as not representing it as it is. If we see them as products or reflections of something peculiar to human experience or to the human perspective on the universe, we assign them a merely ``subjective'' or dependent status and eliminate them from our conception of the world as it is independently of us~\citep[30--31]{stroud2000a}.
\end{squote}

A philosopher who adheres to this distinction might claim that our conception of the world as colored does not represent the world as it is independently of us. Colors, she would claim, are not objectively real. She allows that they are subjectively real, of course. People {\em do} see colors; we have color vision while some species do not. Because of our color vision, we come to believe that the things we see are colored. A philosopher who is skeptical of the objective reality of color ``cannot deny that we perceive many different colours or that we believe physical objects to be coloured''~\citep[145]{stroud2000a}. What the skeptic has to claim is something to the effect that, while we see things {\em as} colored, things are not {\em themselves} colored. The red color of a tomato, on this view, obtains only in our perception of the tomato; there is nothing {\em in} the tomato that is the redness (other species may not see the redness when they see the tomato).% The belief most commonly motivating this type of view, according to Stroud, is a belief that ``the world as it is independently of us'' is simply the world described by an ideal physics: ``physical science can describe every aspect of the figure or shape and the number and motions of the bodies that make up the world. We have words for what we think of as the colours, odours, and tastes of those objects as well, but those words stand for nothing that exists in reality''~(\citeyear[8]{stroud2000a}).

Someone who makes this argument does not, therefore, deny that we perceive colors, or that we believe that things are colored. To claim that we {\em actually don't} think things are colored---that we don't actually believe that tomatoes are red---would obviously be false. We certainly do believe that tomatoes (at least most of them) are red; this is what makes the denial of color interesting. If the philosopher claimed that colors aren't objectively real {\em and that we don't believe them to be}, we ought to wonder why the philosopher is even bothering to make the argument.%
%
%\footnote{}
%
\ It would be like the claim that ghosts don't exist; this is not controversial or interesting, because we don't believe that ghosts exist.

So the philosopher who is denying the objective reality of color must ``recognize the presence in the world of perceptions of and beliefs about the colours of things''~\citep[199]{stroud2000a}. The challenge then is to explain why we do have these perceptions and beliefs. The philosopher who believes that only the world of physics is objectively real must explain the color phenomena in the vocabulary of the physical sciences. (And before this can be attempted, the question arises as to what this vocabulary is: ``Physical science changes. Physicists do not just change their minds as they learn more and more about the world; the very conception of what is to be included in physics changes''~\citep[53]{stroud2000a}.%
%
%\footnote{Cf. Lewis' espousal of materialism: ``an adequate theory must be consistent with the truth and completeness of some theory in much the style of present-day physics\,\ldots\,Some fear that `materialism' conveys a commitment that this ultimate physics must be a physics of matter alone: no fields, no radiation, no causally active spacetime. Not so! Let us proclaim our solidarity with forebears who, like us, wanted their philosophy to agree with ultimate physics. Let us not chide and disown them for their less advanced ideas about what ultimate physics might say''~(\citeyear[332n2]{lewis1997}).}
%
\ So the philosopher relegating colors---or anything else---to subjective reality must have a clear idea of what is left in objective reality.)%

\section{The paraphrase}
\label{paraphrase}
The second sort of denial goes further in denying any kind of reality at all to the subject of inquiry. The philosopher above denied that colors were `objectively real', but not that they were `subjectively real'; she did not deny that we do at least perceive colors. But there are some things that are taken by some philosophers to be neither objectively or subjectively real; they simply do not exist. A philosopher in a cynical mood might deny that love exists. Depending on how recently she was jilted, however, she might not deny that an utterance of ``there is love in the world'' is true. What she would do is paraphrase it as ``there are people in the world who are in symmetrical or asymmetrical relations with other people that can be described as `loving relationships'\,'' (assuming that the cynical philosopher doesn't deny the existence of people as well). If it seems plausible that the original speaker meant something along these lines, then our philosopher has performed `the paraphrase' on love. (The philosopher may or may not go on to claim that the loving relationship is `subjective'; that it would not exist without humans to instantiate it.)
%\ (The original speaker might reject this paraphrase, of course. She might insist that $\exists x(x=Love)$. In this situation we might perform a resolute denial of the sort described in section~\ref{resolute} below and say that there is no existing object that is love.)

Peter van Inwagen attempts to perform the paraphrase on tables, chairs, apples, and every other (inanimate) `composite' object.%
%
\footnote{Just what is meant by a composite objects will be examined later.}
%
\ He takes pains to make clear that his denial of these things is not a relegation of tables and chairs to `subjective reality'. He wants to claim that such things do not exist in any way, subjective or objective:
\begin{squote}
I want to do what I can to disown a certain apparently almost irresistible characterization of my view, or of that part of my view that pertains to inanimate objects. Many philosophers, in conversation and correspondence, have insisted, despite repeated protests on my part, on describing my position in words like these: ``Van Inwagen says that tables are not real''; ``\ldots\,not true objects''; ``\ldots\,not actually {\em things}''; ``\ldots\,not substances''; ``\ldots\,not unified wholes''; ``\ldots\,nothing more than collections of particles.'' These are words that darken counsel. They are, in fact, perfectly meaningless. My position vis-\`{a}-vis tables and other inanimate objects is simply that there {\em are} none~(\citeyear[99]{inwagen1995}).
\end{squote}
Van Inwagen asserts, quite seriously, that ``there are no tables or chairs or any other visible objects except living organisms''~(\citeyear[1]{inwagen1995}). This is a somewhat more bold claim than that of the philosopher skeptical of color. She at least granted that we do see colors, even if we don't actually see things that are (objectively) colored. If, as van Inwagen claims, the only {\em visible} objects are living organisms, then we certainly can't {\em see} tables at all. But just as our color skeptic could not claim that we don't believe in colors, van Inwagen cannot deny that we at least {\em believe} there to be apples. We have many beliefs about what we take to be apples. We believe that they grow on trees, and go well with many types of cheese (which we also believe to exist). Van Inwagen has, therefore, a rather daunting task: he must explain our beliefs about apples (and about cheese, and tables, and chairs, and about everything else he denies) in terms of whatever it is that he does claim to exist (living organisms and the basic particles that make up the physical universe).
%
%\footnote{Van Inwagen assumes, without defense, ``that matter is ultimately particulate\,\ldots\,every material thing is composed of things that have no proper parts: `elementary particles' or `mereological atoms' or `metaphysical simples'\,''~(\citeyear[5]{inwagen1995}). Ted Sider takes him to task for this assumption~(\citeyear{sider1993}), claiming that the possibility of `gunk'---the possibility that the matter of the world is not fundamentally particulate but infinitely divisible---falsifies van Inwagen's thesis. I think it may be possible for van Inwagen to adapt to a gunky world (see Section~\ref{brute}, note~\ref{gunk}), but I think van Inwagen's thesis is false either way.}
%

Van Inwagen does not attempt to deny that we have beliefs about what we take to be apples, cheeses, \&c. Indeed, he admits that ``when people say things in the ordinary business of life by uttering sentences that start `There are chairs\,\ldots ' or `There are stars\,\ldots ', they very often say things that are literally true''~(\citeyear[102]{inwagen1995}). (Van Inwagen himself has argued that ``there is an $x$'', if true, entails the existence of at least one $x$~(\citeyear[237--241]{inwagen1998}).) By conceding this, he distances himself from a skeptical philosopher (see section~\ref{unger} below) whose denial of apples et.\ al.\ is on par with a denial of ghosts. When someone has a belief about what they took to be a ghost, we their belief is not about whatever actually caused their fright; it is most charitable to say that their belief is really about nothing at all (I explain why in section~\ref{resolute}). Van Inwagen, when denying that we have beliefs about apples, appears to maintain that the beliefs that we take (erroneously) to be about apples are not beliefs about {\em nothing}. They are not empty; they are rather beliefs about something {\em else}, something other than what we took them to be about (apples). Van Inwagen accordingly recognizes the need to explain what our beliefs really are about.

What van Inwagen says is that {\em we}, when saying things like ``Some chairs are heavier than some tables'', {\em actually mean} this instead: ``There are $x$s [simple particles] that are arranged chairwise and there are $y$s that are arranged tablewise and the $x$s are heavier than the $y$s''~(\citeyear[109]{inwagen1995}). (Likewise, the beliefs we ordinarily {\em say} are about apples are really beliefs about simples arranged applewise.) This seems to be a highly dubious hypothesis about the speech practices of other people, and van Inwagen expects resistance. He himself mentions a quote of Kripke's that indicates what form the resistance might take:
\begin{squote}
The philosopher advocates a view apparently in patent contradiction to common sense. Rather than repudiating common sense, he asserts that the conflict comes from a philosophical misinterpretation of common language---sometimes he adds that the misinterpretation is encouraged  by the `superficial form' of ordinary speech. He offers his own analysis of the relevant common assertions, one that shows that they do not really say what they seem to say\,\ldots\,I think such philosophical claims are almost invariably suspect. What the claimant calls a `misleading philosophical construal' of the ordinary statement is probably the natural and correct understanding. The real misconstrual comes when the claimant continues, ``All the ordinary man really means is\,\ldots '' and gives a sophisticated analysis compatible with his own philosophy~(\citeyear[65]{kripke1982}).
\end{squote}

I do not think van Inwagen's defense is ultimately successful (see section~\ref{pigletwise}), but it is precisely the sort of defense required when denying the existence of ordinary things like tables and chairs. He cannot claim, without courting absurdity, that we {\em don't} believe there to be tables and chairs in the world. We do believe so. We might, of course, be {\em wrong} about the existence of tables and chairs; ``from the fact that we believe a certain thing it does not follow that it is true''~\citep[21]{stroud2000a}. Nevertheless it is true that we believe there to be such things, and van Inwagen needs to explain the source of this belief. If there are no tables and chairs, then we must be able to understand the beliefs that we thought to be about the furniture to be about something else instead, and we need a story about what that something else is.
% ``you cannot hope to explain something unless you grant that there is such a thing and you have at least some idea of what it is''~\citep[97]{stroud2000a}.
\ As I said, I don't think van Inwagen's explanation is a good one. But before discussing why, we should consider the third and most radical sort of denial.

\section{The resolute denial}
\label{resolute}
The third kind of denial is that which I likened to a denial of ghosts. When I deny the existence of ghosts, I also deny that people talk about and have beliefs about ghosts. Even if someone begins talking to me about the ghost they saw the previous night, I can maintain that there is {\em nothing} in particular that they are talking about. They are certainly not talking about a certain ghost; there are no ghosts, and never have been.

Of course I cannot deny that some people believe that ghosts exist. Some people do believe this. But my resolute denial of the existence of ghosts does not prevent me from explaining someone's belief that there are ghosts. This someone, for example, might tell me that she saw a ghost on the landing. I walk out and see a light from a high window flickering strangely on the wall. (If I squint, the pattern of the light looks almost humanoid.) So I tell her that what she thought was a ghost was really just a curious play of the light. I am not here conceding that she had a belief {\em about} a ghost. On the contrary, I have tried to show her that her belief was about anything but a ghost. There was in fact no ghost that she could have formed a belief about; ``if we show that what a frightened person saw in the attic on a particular occasion was a rippling reflection of the moon through the window, we implicitly deny the presence of a ghost in giving the explanation of the person's belief and fear''~\citep[76]{stroud2000a}. We do not deny that people have beliefs about what they take to be ghosts; what we deny is that they are correct in taking their beliefs to be about ghosts.

Likewise, suppose she and I are looking in on an empty, well-lit room. Suddenly she points and cries, ``Look, a ghost!'' In this case there is nothing in the room that I can assume to have caused this belief. There are no reflections of the moon or curious plays of the light; as far as I can tell, she is pointing at nothing.

\stage{Me}{}{What on earth do you mean?}

\stage{Her}{(pointing)}{That ghost, there! See?}

If this continues, the most probable explanation is that she is having an hallucination. She has what she takes to be a belief about a ghost in the room. There is no ghost in the room, so what is her belief about? 

In Stroud's example above, we might say that the person is frightened of the reflection of the moon. This is similar to how we might talk about a child's night terrors: ``she was afraid of the chair in her room (she thought it was a monster).'' Looking at things this way, the person's beliefs is {\em about} something, but it is something very different from what they took it to be about. I think, however, that this is not a fully accurate characterization of the object of the person's belief. It may be true that the reflection of the moon {\em caused} her belief (which caused her fright), but it would be at least a little misleading to say that Mrs --------- is frightened of the reflection of the moon. This is misleading because, if we succeed in showing her that there {\em is} no ghost in the attic (only a reflection of the moon), she will not still be afraid. When she understands that her belief in the ghost was mistaken, she will see that there is {\em nothing} to be afraid of. The belief that caused her fright, that there was a ghost in the attic, was in fact a belief about nothing at all. (The same goes for the person who sees the play of light on the wall and believes that there is a ghost.)

In the second example, is her belief actually about the {\em hallucination}\,? Again, charity demands that we not say this. If she is convinced that nobody else sees a ghost, she may recognize that she was hallucinating. Were she to come to this conclusion, she would no longer be afraid of what she saw (though she will no doubt be afraid that she is going mad). The belief that she took to be about a ghost was in fact about nothing at all.

\subsection{Unger's nihilism}
\label{unger}
Just as resolutely as we denied the existence of ghosts, so Peter Unger has denied the existence of such things as ``tables and chairs and spears\,\ldots\,swizzle sticks and sousaphones\,\ldots\,stones and rocks and twigs, and also tumbleweeds and fingernails''~(\citeyear[117]{unger1979}). He does not consider them merely `subjectively real' as opposed to objectively so---like van Inwagen, he claims that they simply do not exist. He comes to this conclusion from a different direction, however. As we will see, van Inwagen's denial of the existence of `ordinary things' is a consequence of his theory of composition (under what conditions some things compose another thing). Unger, on the other hand, draws his conclusion from an application of the sorites paradox:%
%
\footnote{Unger also motivates his nihilism by way of `the problem of the many'. Unfortunately I do not understand what exactly this problem is. Unger directs our attention to a cloud; looking at the edge of the cloud, ``we may find, side by side, or themselves overlapping, a great many potential boundaries for clouds\,\ldots\,if our alleged typical item [the cloud] is indeed a typical cloud, then many of these candidates, millions at least, do not fail to be clouds altogether but are clouds of some sort''~(\citeyear[420--421]{unger1980a}). Unger draws the conclusion from this and similar arguments that either there are millions of clouds there, or none (and prefers the latter disjunct). But this conclusion seems unwarranted. If a cloud is a concentration of water molecules in the air, then the boundaries of the cloud are where the amount of water in the air is normal. There are not millions of clouds with millions of different boundaries; any stipulated boundary that falls inside or outside the actual boundary is arbitrary because it does not track the concentration of water molecules.}
%
\begin{squote}
Consider a stone, consisting of a certain finite number of atoms. If we or some physical process should remove one atom, without replacement, then there is left that number minus one, presumably constituting a stone still\,\ldots\,after another atom is removed, there is that original number minus two; so far, so good. But after that certain number has been removed, in similar stepwise fashion, there are no atoms at all in the situation, while we must still be supposing that there is a stone there. But as we have already agreed, if there is a stone present, then there must
be some atoms\,\ldots\,I suggest that any adequate response to this contradiction must include\,\ldots\,the denial of the existence of even a single stone.~\citep[121--122]{unger1979}
\end{squote}

Having made this denial, Unger must either explain how our beliefs about stones should be understood (van Inwagen has his paraphrasing strategy) or he must deny that we really {\em do} have any beliefs about stones. It appears that he selects the latter option: Unger seems to claim that, like the person who thought they had a belief about a ghost, we are wrong to think that we have any coherent beliefs about stones or any other ordinary things. Unger says that, like `ghost', our ``terms for ordinary things are incoherent [and] cannot apply to anything real''~\citep[147]{unger1979}. A consequence of this is that our language and thought concerning all such things is directed toward {\em nothing at all}: ``it may well be that I have never {\em thought of} any stones at all, or tables, or even human hands. If that is so, then it would seem that {\em a fortiori} I do not {\em know} anything {\em about these entities}, however commonly I might otherwise suppose''~(\citeyear[458]{unger1980a}).

This all seems very strange. Concerning ghosts, ``it is difficult even to find a fully coherent belief that might be exposed as false; we discover, at best, obscurity or perhaps confusion\,\ldots\,do we really understand what sort of thing a ghost is supposed to be''~\citep[76]{stroud2000a}? If someone tries to tell me about the ghost that visited him the previous night, it does not seem unjust to say that he really doesn't know what he is talking about. But can this be extended to some of the most common objects of experience?

When we denied the existence of ghosts, we denied also others' beliefs in them. We did not, however, deny that people have beliefs which they take to be about ghosts. But we were able to show that these beliefs were not {\em about} ghosts; in most cases they were about nothing at all. Likewise, Unger cannot deny that we have beliefs that we take to be about tables, chairs, and all the other things that he denies exist. If our beliefs about tables and chairs are really beliefs about nothing at all, there are two questions that must be answered: first, what causes us to form these beliefs?\ and second, if the utterances containing these empty terms are about nothing at all, how do we manage to communicate so effectively using them?

\subsubsection{Causes of belief}
\label{unger-cause}
People who believe in ghosts probably do so because they have unreflectively embraced the superstitions of their culture. They may initially come to believe that ghosts exist on the testimony of other people---older siblings, perhaps---or by reading too many ghost stories. Much as Catherine in Jane Austen's {\em Northanger Abbey} jumps to the most macabre conclusions as a result of having absorbed too many gothic novels, so might our gullible reader of ghost stories interpret such innocent phenomena as reflections of the moon as ghostly assailants. Those of us who have not taken our cues from fiction would be more likely to recognize such phenomena as tricks of the light. Even if we were to see something that was definitely {\em not} a trick of the light, we would sooner attribute it to an hallucination than countenance the possibility of ghosts:
%
\begin{squote}
She rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; but even as I fixed, and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed away~\citep[58]{james1991}.
\end{squote}
%
Most of us would still, even if presented with such a vision, {\em refuse to believe in ghosts}. This is because we know that the probability of there being such spirits is far less than the probability of us experiencing cracks in our sanity. Undermining my belief that ghosts don't exist would require a great deal---for example, my friend and I both seeing the {\em same} apparent ghost at the same time, and knowing that we were each experiencing the same vision. (Even then, we would want further confirmed sightings to convince us that we weren't, in fact, crazy.)

If this is an accurate characterization of our beliefs concerning ghosts, it is a very different characterization than one we might give of how we learn about and come to believe in chairs. Chairs are not something that children learn about from stories. A child learns what a chair is as an answer to the question, ``What is {\em that?}\,'' Let us suppose that the child is pointing at a chair in the center of a well-lit room containing no other furniture. The chair is clearly visible. If someone were to believe they were pointing at a ghost in a similarly well-lit situation, we could safely assume that they would be experiencing a hallucination. Hallucinations are not shared experiences; if one person is hallucinating a ghost, nobody else can see that ghost, not even if they were {\em also} hallucinating a ghost (they can't both hallucinate the {\em same} ghost). Such a ghost sighting, therefore, would necessarily be experienced by a single person. A chair, on the other hand, can be sighted by multiple people simultaneously. The parent sees the same chair that the child sees. This is what allows the parent to answer the child's question (``That's a chair'') and this is how the child learns about chairs. We learn about chairs by coming upon them in the world, and being {\em told} what it is we have come upon. This brings us to communication.

\subsubsection{Communication and incoherence}
\label{unger-comm}
A consequence of Peter Unger's thesis is that most of our communication is empty of content, if not entirely incoherent. For me to warn my friend of a low-hanging tree branch, I must refer her to it. For her to heed my warning, she must recognize my intention to refer to the branch in question, and, as a result of that intention, herself come to think of the branch (and then duck). But according to Unger, ``when we are under the impression that we are thinking about an object in the world\,\ldots\,our impression is mistaken''~(\citeyear[149]{unger1979}). Unger is denying that I can ever possibly warn my friend about a low-hanging branch.

This seems plainly false. For, after all, my friend ducked. She heard my warning and avoided the low-hanging branch. Unless we are to suppose that it was sheer luck that she moved her head in time to dodge the branch, we must conclude that I did, in fact, warn my friend. If I did, in fact, warn my friend, then we both thought of the branch. (It doesn't really matter how Unger argues for the impossibility of such communication; it {\em does} succeed.)% (I want to set it down as an axiom that \textsc{communication occurs}.)

That ought to be enough to prove Unger wrong. Just to be thorough, however, let's return to our well-lit room. There is a chair in the center of it. A child and her parent enter.

\stage{Child}{(pointing at the chair)}{What's that?}

Now, if the parent is going to be in a position to understand the question, she must recognize the intention of the child to refer to the chair; recognizing this intention, she comes herself to think of the chair. Only if this process occurs can the parent know what the child means by ``that''. Having performed this feat, the parent can then tell the child ``That's a chair''. If the child was hallucinating the chair (if the room was really empty), then the parent could not recognize the referential intention of the child. She could not recognize a referential intention, because that would require her to think of the object that the child is thinking of (and intending to refer to). But as I have argued, the child, if hallucinating a chair, has a belief about {\em nothing} in particular. The parent cannot come to think of the child's hallucination, at least not as a result of recognizing the child's referential intention (she may come to think {\em that} her child is hallucinating, but that's a different matter). Rather, she will look at an empty room and say

\stage{Parent}{}{What's what?}

But if the room is not empty, and the child is not hallucinating, then the parent {\em will} recognize the child's referential intention. If the child is referring to a chair, then the parent will say ``That's a chair''.

And yet somehow Unger maintains that the kind of object picked out by `chair' is ``never instanced''~(\citeyear[147]{unger1979}). That is, the word ``chair'' necessarily has no application in the world. But suppose that this happens instead: 

\stage{Child}{}{I love the color of this chair!}

\stage{Parent}{}{I painted it just for you.}

\noindent How is Unger supposed to explain their communication? The child, according to Unger, has no determinate thought; she is certainly not thinking of a {\em chair}. Nor is the parent thinking of a chair. Unger might say that, just as people see things (reflections of the moon) that they mistakenly take to be of a ghost, so the child and parent are seeing something that each mistakenly takes to be a chair.

But now what could they be seeing? This is a well-lit, sparsely furnished room. There is no chance of curious plays of the light or visual tricks that might deceive the child and her parent. If the child claimed to be seeing a ghost in such a room, then (as above) we should have to say that she is hallucinating. Is the child then hallucinating a chair? If this were the case, then (as above) we should not expect the parent to understand the referential intention. Yet she apparently does. Are {\em both} of them hallucinating? That would allow us to say that communication appears to succeed when in fact it does not. But for the parent and child to have such similar hallucinations is incredibly unlikely. It may happen on rare occasions, but to say that such a coincidence is actually a daily occurrence is absurd.

\stage{Peter Unger}{}{I never said the room was {\em empty}. It isn't empty. But that doesn't mean that there is a {\em chair} in the room. There's something else entirely.}

\noindent Now we may ask, ``What {\em is} in the room, if not a chair?'' Unger might walk over to the chair, saying ``There seems to be a concentration of solid matter in this vicinity which, when placed appropriately, may be sat on.'' And now we say, ``Oh, you mean a {\em chair!} That's what it's called, you see.''

\subsection{The moral}
There are limits to what one can resolutely deny the existence of. We can deny that certain things, like ghosts, exist {\em and} deny that people have beliefs in them. We can do this because in each situation where a person has a belief about what they take to be a ghost, we can show that their belief is really about nothing at all. If someone sees a reflection of the moon or experiences a hallucination, and so thinks she is seeing a ghost, we can say that she is afraid of nothing at all. Under no circumstances must we say that her belief is really about a ghost. Moreover, we can explain how people come to believe in ghosts---they read too many ghost stories, or believe the lies of others.

This is not something we can do with tables, chairs, and other ``ordinary things'', let alone people. For one, Unger has no explanation of how we come to form our beliefs in these things, if not by {\em seeing them}. Secondly, to deny that our thought and talk about such things are really about nothing at all is to deny that communication regularly occurs. Bizarrely, this is a consequence Unger appears willing to accept:
\begin{squote}
Now, it must of course be admitted that these arguments [for his strain of nihilism] undermine the possibility of any endeavor I should try to propose, or even the putative thought that I should propose anything, just as all of my putative essay is undermined. But even so, I shall (incoherently) propose that what we have now to do is invent new expressions which are not inconsistent ones, and by means of which we may, to some significant extent, think coherently about concrete reality~(\citeyear[544]{unger1980b}).
\end{squote}
If Unger seriously believes this, then he could not expect us even to understand his essay ({\em why would he write it?}). But I think it is safe to say that Unger does {\em not} actually believe that there are no people or ordinary things. In a book on ethics, Unger has unambiguously expressed his belief in people:

\begin{squote}
Each year millions of children die from easy to beat disease, from malnutrition, and from bad drinking water\,\ldots\,As UNICEF has made clear to millions of us well-off American adults at one time or another, with a packet of oral rehydration salts that costs 15 cents, a child can be saved from dying soon~(\citeyear[3]{unger1996}).
\end{squote}
There are only two possibilities: either Unger does believe that people (at least children and Americans) do exist, or he takes himself to be flat-out lying in the quoted passage.

As far as other ordinary things go, Unger claims to ``often now believe that there really are no tables or rocks, and never so firmly believe that there are such things as I once did''~(\citeyear[543]{unger1980b}). All I can say is that I don't believe him. (To show that he does believe in these things, we would need to spend some time with him, observing his behavior. We could invite him for a walk along a trail with lots of low-hanging branches, then warn him about them.)

%Moreover, if we had any reason to believe that we hallucinated on a regular basis, not only would communication break down, but we would be incapable of even ascribing beliefs to other people.

%\begin{squote}
%we who inhabit the world can understand someone in that world as believing something or as perceiving something only if we can somehow connect the possession of the psychological states we attribute to the person with facts and events in the surrounding world that we take the beliefs and perceptions to be about. We understand one another to be parts of, and engaged in, a common world we all share. If we ourselves had no beliefs at all about what is happening in the environment or what another person is most likely to be paying attention to, we would be in no position to attribute any beliefs or perceptions to that person at all~\citep[150--151]{stroud2000a}.
