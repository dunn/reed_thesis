\title{How do chairs persist over time?}

\label{parts}

In the previous section I argued that not only do `material things'
like chairs exist, but other kinds of things---like teams and
families---exist as well.  In this section I will adopt Kit Fine's
theory of parthood, which claims that there are many different ways of
being a part of something.  The legs of a chair are part of the chair
in one way, and the Supreme Court justices are parts of the Supreme
Court in another way.  Fine's theory shows that this is because a
chair and the Supreme Court are different kinds of things.

Fine's theory by itself does not tell us what kind of thing a chair
is, or what kind of thing the Supreme Court is.  A chair might be a
{\em mereological sum}, or it might be something else.  The Supreme
Court might be a {\em set}, or it might be something else.  Fine's
theory does not tell us what these things are, but it does give us the
resources to start thinking up possible answers.

I will argue in this section that there are only two possible
answers.  If chairs are {\em not} identical with mereological sums,
then the things that are parts of a chair (in one way) will be the
same things that are part of a mereological sum (in another way).  In
other words, we will have {\em co-located objects}.  And once we have
two objects located in the same place, there will be pressure to
recognize more.  We may find ourselves with a {\em plurality} of
co-located objects.  (There is an analogous problem if the Supreme
Court is not identical with a set.  If there is some other thing that
has the same parts (but has them in a different way), we will find
that it is possible that there be a large number of different kinds of
things, all with the same parts.)

The second answer is to affirm that chairs are identical with
mereological sums.  This will allow us to deny that there are a
plurality of co-located objects where my chair is; we will be able to
say that there is just the one thing---the chair.  But this answer has
unintuitive consequences as well.  It is generally thought that
mereological sums cannot change their parts, but it is generally
thought that chairs can change their parts.  If we defend this second
answer, then, we will have to interpret talk about `the same chair'
over time as being talk about {\em different} sums over time.  The
appearance of persistence over time (and through change) is a product
of {\em conventions} that govern terms like `chair'.  What
mereological sum is the referent of `the chair' from one day to the
next depends not upon the actual identity of the two referents, but
upon convention.

\section{Parthood and the language of composition}
\label{parthood}
I argued in section \ref{plural-ref} that things like teams, crews,
and families are indeed {\em things}.  Terms like `team', `crew', and
`family' are not disguised references to plurals.  Moreover, things
like teams are things with {\em parts}.  The rugby players are each
{\em part} of the Reed College women's rugby team.  The team is made
up of---it is composed of---the players.

When I say that the players are part of the team, or that the
crewmembers are part of the crew, or that I am part of my family, is
that use of `part' the same as when I say that the tree is part of the
dogbush, or that the seat is part of the chair?  Are {\em any} of
these uses of `part' the same?

Technical notions of composition are often defined in terms of
parthood.  How I am using the term `part' will therefore influence how
I construct formal equivalences for propositions like ``there are
chairs'', ``there are dogbushes'', and ``there are teams''.  Is the
appropriate formalization for each of these the same?  Can chairs,
dogbushes, and teams each `fit in' to the schema ``there is an $x$
such that it is composed of the $y$s''?  Or is `composition' one of
many {\em operations} that `produce' things?

\subsection{Van Inwagen's notion of parthood}
\label{van-part}
Van Inwagen defines his technical notion of composition (see section
\ref{scq}) in terms of a largely intuitive notion of parthood.  Van
Inwagen's interest, however, is restricted to `material' objects
(objects made exclusively of quarks and protons, or whatever the basic
atoms of the physical world turn out to be).  While he goes on to use
`part' only in reference to material objects, he recognizes that the
term has much wider application:

\begin{squote}
Parthood will occupy a central place in the present study of material
objects.  It is therefore worth noting that the word `part' is applied
to many things besides material objects.  We have already noted that
submicroscopic objects like quarks and protons are at least not clear
cases of material objects; nevertheless, every material object would
seem pretty clearly to have quarks and protons as \emph{parts}, and,
it would seem, in exactly the same sense of \emph{part} as that in
which a paradigmatic material object might have another paradigmatic
material object as a part.  A ``part,'' therefore, need not be a thing
that is clearly a material object.  Moreover, the word `part' is
applied to things that are clearly \emph{not} material objects---or at
least it is on the assumption that these things really exist and that
apparent reference to them is not a mere manner of speaking.  A stanza
is a part of a poem; Botvinnik was in trouble for part of the game;
the part of the curve that lies below the x-axis contains two minima;
parts of his story are hard to believe\,\ldots\,such examples can be
multiplied indefinitely.  Does this word `part' mean the same thing
when we speak of parts of cats, parts of poems, parts of games, parts
of curves, and parts of stories \citeyearpar[18--19]{inwagen1995}?
\end{squote} 

Van Inwagen suggests that `part' does have a number of different
meanings.  Later he says that ``there is one relation called
`parthood' whose field comprises material objects\,\ldots\,another
relation called `parthood' defined on events, another still defined on
stories, yet another defined on curves, and so on''
\citeyearpar[19]{inwagen1995}.

This may very well be, but what is the similarity between these
relations?  The parthood relation in classical mereology is
well-defined, as is the membership relation in set theory.  But there
is no equally well-defined relation for event parthood, or poem parthood.

However, Kit Fine has proposed a theory of parthood that takes
seriously the possibility that there are a plurality of different
parthood relations, and has the resources to define numerous parthood
relations.  The parthood relation for poems may be given as rigorous a
treatment as the parthood relation for sets.

\section{Fine's theory of part}
\label{fine}
Fine agrees with van Inwagen that the notion of parthood should not be
reserved only for material things:

\begin{squote}
Philosophers have often supposed the notion of part only has proper
application to material things or the like and that its application
to abstract objects such as sets or properties is somehow improper
and not sanctioned by ordinary use.  But I suspect that this is
something of a philosopherâ€™s myth.  We happily talk of a sentence
being composed of words and of the words being composed of
letters---and not just the sentence and work tokens, mind, but also
the types.  And similarly, a symphony (and not just its performance)
will be composed of movements, a play of acts, a proof of steps.  I
wonder how many of these philosophers have said such things as ``this
paper is in three parts.''  When they have, then I very much doubt
that they would have any inclination, as ordinary speakers of the
language, to add ``but not, of course, in a strict or literal sense of
the term''; and the intended reference here is not primarily---or
perhaps not at all---to the tokens of the paper but to the type of
which they are the tokens.  The evidence concerning our ordinary talk
of part is mixed and complicated, but it does not seem especially to
favor taking material things to be the only true relata of the
relation \citeyearpar[561]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

But even if one accepts the idea that there are things other than
`material things' that have parts, one might object that they are
still all parts in the same sense.  This might be the parthood
relation of classical mereology, or it might be some other, general
relation.  Moreover, one who maintained the univocality of parthood
can still concede that there are different ways of being a part.  But
for the believer in the univocality of parthood---the `monist'---these
are only {\em derivative} kinds of parthood.  For example, for any
given mereological sum, there are bigger and smaller parts of it. But
these are bigger and smaller parts of the same {\em kind}.  The
pluralist goes further and claims that there are parts of different
kinds. These different kinds are not derivative but \emph{basic}; they
are ``not definable in terms of other ways of being a part''
\citep[561]{fine2010}.  Fine gives a number of reasons to think that
there might be different basic parthood relations:

\begin{squote}
Now, on the face of it, there would appear to be a wide variety of
basic ways in which one object can be a part of another.  The letter
`n' would appear to be a part of the expression `no', for example, and
a particular pint of milk part of a particular quart; and if these two
relations of part are not themselves basic (perhaps through being
restricted to expressions or quantities), there would appear to be
basic relations of part that hold between `n' and `no' or the pint and
the quart.  It is also plausible that the way in which `n' is a part
of `no' is different from the way in which the pint is a part of the
quart.  For if the two ways were the same, then how could it be that
two pints were only capable of composing a single quart, while the two
letters `n' and `o' were capable of composing two expressions, `no'
and `on' \citeyearpar[562]{fine2010}?
\end{squote}

The parthood relation for sets is again different.  The set containing
the only the letters `n' and `o' has the letters as parts.  When the
letters are parts of a set, their order is irrelevant, but when the
letters are parts of a word, order matters; hence `no' and `on'.  The
parthood relation for sets is also different from the parthood
relation for quantities (of milk):

\begin{squote}
If four quarts compose a gallon the pints which compose the quarts
will compose the gallon in the same way in which they compose the
quarts, whereas, if four sets compose a further set the members of the
sets will not compose the further set in the same way in which they
compose the component sets.  Thus we would now appear to have three
different basic ways in which one object can be a part of another
(pint/gallon, letter/word, and member/set); and once these cases have
been granted, it is plausible that there will be many more
\citeyearpar[562]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

One might, of course, refuse to grant these cases.  But one would have
to refuse them {\em all}; for if it can be established that there are
even two different (basic) ways of being a part, then the pluralist
position is established.  Once it is established that there are at
least two ways of being a part, it becomes much more plausible that
there might be three ways, or more.  Fine therefore attempts to
motivate the idea that the members of a set are, quite literally,
parts of the set.

\subsection{Parts of sets}
\label{sets}
The first objection is that while parthood is supposed to be
transitive, the membership relation of sets is not.  The letter `n' is
a member of the set \{`n',\{`n',`o'\}\}, but `o' is not.  The
objection claims that sets have {\em members}, not parts, and that
Fine has confused the two.

But while it is true that the membership relation is not the parthood
relation, this is no reason to think that sets do not have parts.  A
given set will have certain members---the $x$s---and certain
parts---the $y$s---and only sometimes will the $x$s and the $y$s be
the very same things.  The set \{`n',\{`n',`o'\}\} has two members
but three parts.  The parthood relation for sets can even be defined
in set-theoretic terms:

\begin{squote}
It may well be thought that the way in which a member is a part of a
set is given, not by the membership relation itself, but by the
ancestral of the membership relation, where this is the relation that
holds between $x$ and $y$ when $x$ is a member of $y$ or a member of a
member of $y$ or a member of a member of a member of $y$, and so on
\citep[563]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

A second objection is that talk of parthood in connection with things
like sets is somehow metaphorical or non-literal.  We saw above that
van Inwagen admits that many different things are said to have parts.
However, he qualifies this in two ways.  First, he seems to have
doubts (or at least is sympathetic with those who have doubts) as to
whether the non-material things that are said to have parts really
exist:

\begin{squote}
The word `part' is applied to things that are clearly \emph{not}
material objects---or at least it is on the assumption that these
things really exist and that apparent reference to them is not a mere
manner of speaking \citep[19]{inwagen1995}.
\end{squote}

If there are no such things as tennis matches or poems or papers, then
of course they do not have parts.  But I think it is obviously true
that there are such things.  This being so, what does it mean to say
that they have parts?  This is where van Inwagen's second
qualification comes in.  For he suggests not only that the `parts' of
tennis matches and poems are parts in a different way than are the
parts of a table, but that these different relations of parthood are
only tenuously connected.  Van Inwagen says that the various relations
of parthood (if such there be) are connected only by the ``unity of
analogy'' \citeyearpar[19]{inwagen1995}.  If the only similarity
between the parthood relation for poems and the parthood relation for
chairs is that they share the `analogy' of parthood, then is there
anything important or interesting about `parts' of poems?  Is the
parthood relation for sets likewise only interesting because of the
analogy with the parthood relation for chairs?

At least in the case of parthood for sets, the notion does not appear
to be wholly metaphorical:

\begin{squote}
In the case of set-membership, there would appear to be nothing that
might plausibly be taken to indicate that the talk of part-whole is
not to be taken literally. A set is indeed composed of or built up
from its members, and we should add that we may meaningfully
talk---and in the intended way---of \emph{replacing} one member of a
set with another.  Thus Aristotle in the set \{Plato, Aristotle\} may
be replaced with Socrates to obtain the set \{Plato, Socrates\}, with
the given set becoming a different set from what it was. In the case
of sets, our conception of members as parts seems to extend all the
way \citep[564]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

But the second worry raised by van Inwagen remains.  Why should we
think that there is any {\em real} similarity between these different
parthood relations, other than the fact that we call them all
`parthood'?

\subsection{Operationalism}
\label{operation}
Fine's theory of {\em operationalism} helps answer this worry.
Various {\em operations} produce different things---mereological
summation produces mereological sums or fusions, the set-builder
produces sets, and so forth.  Parts are therefore {\em things} that
have been `combined', through one or more such operations, into a
single {\em thing}.  What is common to all parthood relations is that
from each set of parts is produced a {\em whole} by means of a
composition operator.  From parts (letters, atoms) are made something
else (a word, a set, a chair).  What ties together all the ways of
being a part is that they are involved in a composition operation that
produces a single thing from a number of things:

\begin{squote}
In formulating the principles of mereology, it has been usual to take
the relation of part-whole or some associated relation (such as
overlap) as primitive.  But I believe that, in formulating a more
general theory, it is important to take the operation of composition
as primitive rather than the more familiar relation of part-whole.  In
the case of classical mereology, the operation of composition will
take some objects into the sum or fusion of those objects, while, in
the set-theoretic case, it will take some objects into the set of
those objects; and, in general, the operation of composition will be
the characteristic means (summation, set-builder, and so on) by which
a given kind of whole is formed from its parts \citep[565]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

Each way of being a part can then be defined in terms of the related
composition operation:

\begin{squote}
Once given a compositional operation, a corresponding relation of part
may be defined in two steps.  We say first that $x$ is a component of
$y$ if $y$ is the result of applying $\sum$ to $x$ or to $x$ and some
other objects.  In other words, $y$ should be of the form $\sum
(x_{1}, x_{2}, \mathellipsis )$, where at least one of $x_1$, $x_2,
\mathellipsis$ is $x$.  Thus when $\sum$ is mereological summation the
components of an object will be mere parts, and where $\sum$ is the
set-builder the components of an object will be its members.  We may
then define $x$ to be a part of $y$ if there is a sequence of objects
$x_1$, $x_2, \mathellipsis x_n$, $n$ \textgreater{} $0$, for which $x
= x_1$, $y = x_n$, and $x_i$ is a component of $x_{i+1}$ for $i = 1$,
$2, \mathellipsis, n-1$. The parts of an object are the object itself,
or its components, or the components of the components, and so on
\citep[567--568]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

The parthood relation for mereological sums can therefore be seen to
exhibit reflexivity, transitivity and anti-symmetry:

\begin{description}
\item[Reflexivity] Each object is a part of itself.
\item[Transitivity] If $x$ is a part of $y$ and $y$ of $z$, then $x$
  is a part of $z$.
\item[Anti-symmetry] $x$ is a part of $y$ and $y$ of $x$ only when $x
  = y$ \citep[568]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

But not all definitions of parthood that issue from a composition
operator will exhibit these features:

\begin{squote}
When the underlying operation is summation, each object will be a part
of itself, since the unit sum of any object is the object itself, but
when the underlying operation is the set-builder, no object will be a
part of itself, since no object is ever an ancestral member of itself
\citep[569]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

\subsection{Principles}
\label{principle}
Each composition operation will, according to Fine, be governed by
various principles:

\begin{squote}
I believe that the principles governing the basic forms of composition
will conform to a general template.  Variations in the principles for
the different forms of composition will then arise from variations in
how the template is to be filled in.  The template will comprise two
broad categories of principle---the {\em formal} and the {\em
  material} (though not quite in the sense of Husserl).  Among the
formal principles, we may distinguish between those that provide
conditions of application for the operation and those that provide
identity conditions; among the material principles, we may distinguish
between those that provide conditions for the presence of a whole (in
space and time or at a world) and those that specify the descriptive
character of the whole.  The presence conditions, in their turn, may
concern either the existence of the whole or its extension
\citeyearpar[569--570]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

\paragraph{Formal principles}
\label{formal}
The formal principles govern when composition occurs and when two
products of a composition operation are identical:

\begin{description}
  \item[Application] The application conditions are ``the conditions
    under which there are wholes of a given sort---which, on the
    operational approach, is a matter of stating when the result of
    applying the compositional operation to various objects will be
    defined'' \citep[570]{fine2010}.  For the summation operation, the
    application conditions are very lax: for any $n$ physical objects
    (where $n$ \textgreater{} 1), there is a thing composed of those
    objects.  The application conditions for the set-builder will be
    more limited; and other operations will be more restricted
    still. \label{fine-app}
  \item[Identity] Setting out identity conditions on Fine's
    operational approach ``is a matter of stating when a whole formed
    in one way by means of the compositional operation is the same as
    a given object or a whole that has been formed in some other way''
    \citeyearpar[570]{fine2010}.  For example, suppose $y$ is the
    result of applying the summation operator to $x$, and suppose
    $y^\prime$ is the result of applying the set-builder to $x$.  If
    $y \neq y^\prime$, it will be because of some difference in the
    respective operations that produced these composites.  As we will
    see below, the summation operator is defined such that its
    application to a single thing ($x$) produces that very thing.  The
    set-builder, however, produces the singleton of $x$, which is not
    $x$.  And whereas applying the set-builder to nothing produces the
    null set, the result of applying the summation operator to nothing
    might be undefined---nothing would result.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Material principles}
\label{material}
As above, there are two subcategories:

\begin{description}
  \item[Presence] Fine claims that ``there are two fundamentally
    different ways in which an object might be present in space or
    time; it may \emph{exist} in space or time, or it may be
    \emph{extended} (or \emph{located}) in space or time. Thus a
    material thing will exist in time but be extended in space while
    an event will be extended in both space and time''
    \citeyearpar[570]{fine2010}.  Whether or not this is actually true
    seems to depend on whether a `three-dimensional' theory of
    persistence is correct.  However, that question will remain unasked.
  \item[Character] ``The character conditions will tend to have a much
    more ad hoc character than the other conditions that we have
    considered. The color of a house, for example, is the color of its
    siding; the color of an egg, the color of its shell; the color of
    a pencil, the color of its lead. In the case of the `intrinsic'
    character of a thing---such as its mass or color---the character
    of the whole will be some sort of function of the character of the
    parts. But the function in question will vary from case to case''
    \citep[571]{fine2010}.  What we decide is the color of a house
    will turn on our concept `house', rather than anything about the
    house itself (anything beyond its having that color to {\em some}
    extent).
\end{description}

\subsection{Fine's pluralist account of classical mereology}
\label{classical}
Of the principles sketched above, Fine gives most attention to the
identity conditions for composition operations.  The composition
operation used as a paradigm is the summation operation of classical
mereology.  Fine's exposition of identity conditions for sums relies
on the notion of `regularity':

\begin{squote}
Call an identity condition $s = t$ {\em regular} if the variables
appearing in $s$ and in $t$ are the same.  Thus $\sum (x, y) = \sum
(y, x)$ is regular while $\sum (x, y) = x$ is not
\citeyearpar[572]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

With this notion in hand, Fine proposes this condition for identity of
sums:

\begin{description}
  \item[Summative Identity] $s = t$ whenever `$s = t$' is a regular
    identity \citeyearpar[572]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

One particularly interesting aspect of this condition is that it
entails four more principles of the summation operation:

\begin{description}
  \item[Absorption] $\sum (\mathellipsis, x, x, \mathellipsis,
    \mathellipsis, y, y, \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis = \sum (
    \mathellipsis, x, \mathellipsis, y, \mathellipsis )$;
\item[Collapse] $\sum (x) = x$;
\item[Leveling] $\sum (\mathellipsis, \sum (x, y, z, \mathellipsis ),
  \mathellipsis, \sum (u, v, w, \mathellipsis ), \mathellipsis ) \\ =
  \sum (\mathellipsis, x, y, z, \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis, u, v, w,
  \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis )$;
\item[Permutation] $\sum (x, y, z, \mathellipsis ) = \sum (y, z, x,
  \mathellipsis )$ (and similarly for all other permutations)
  \citep[573]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

We can define other compositional identity criteria (e.g., sequences)
in terms of which of these principles apply to their compositional
operation.  But we may also devise new principles by which we may then
define new types of composition:

\begin{squote}
We should note that there would appear to be no good reason to require
that the defining principles for the various operations should be
limited to the particular principles (C [collapse], L [leveling], A
[absorption], and P [permutation]) that we used in characterizing
sums; for any set of regular identities would appear to be equally
well suited to defining a basic form of composition, so long as they
conform to Anti-cyclicity.  Indeed, I would conjecture that any such
set of principles in fact will correspond to a form of composition and
a corresponding form of whole.  How the resulting forms of composition
and whole might be organized is an interesting question, but it should
be apparent that the approach will lead to an infinitude of forms of
composition, each differing from one another in how exactly the
identity of the resulting wholes is to be
determined. \citep[575--576]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

It is at this point that the importance of Fine's theory becomes
obvious.  Above I stressed that things like teams and families are
really {\em things}; moreover I made this claim as part of an attempt
to motivate a sort of universalistic outlook on metaphysics.  I argued
that the term `composition' was potentially misleading, but that it
was nevertheless correct to say that things like dogbushes, wish
sandwiches, and teams are composed of their parts.  But now it is
apparent that `composition' will mean something different when applied
to each of these things.  Each thing will be the product of a
different composition operation.

Fine's theory reveals new {\em kinds} of universalism.  One might be
committed to the existence of dogbushes---and so to unrestricted
mereological composition---but deny the existence of teams, groups,
crews, and families.  Or one might defend unrestricted composition of
groups while claiming a restriction on mereological composition.

Below I will look at how a definition of the composition operator for
groups might be formulated.  But I will first return to Fine's theory.

\subsection{Hybrid parts}
\label{hybrid}
Above, we saw that one objection to the idea of sets having parts was
that parthood is transitive and set-membership is not.  Moreover it
was supposed (rather plausibly) that the only reason we think that
sets have parts is {\em because} they have members; it is the members
of a set that we are tempted to call parts.  But, the objection goes,
it is a mistake to think of members as part.  I am the only member of
my singleton (the singleton of $x$ is the set resulting from applying
the set-builder to $x$ alone).  My hand, for instance, is not a member
of my singleton.  But my hand is a part of me.  If I was a part of my
singleton, then---because parthood is transitive---my hand would be a
part of my singleton.  And if that means that my hand is a {\em
  member} of my singleton, that is clearly wrong.

Fine points out, of course, that the objection makes the mistake of
supposing that something (me, my hand) can be a part in only one way
(in this case, through set-membership).  Once we recognize that there
are a plurality of ways of being a part, it becomes clear that my hand
is part of the set in one way, but not in another:

\begin{squote}
Given the specific relations of part, we may derive various {\em
  hybrid} relations of part.  Suppose, for example, that we are given
the relations of set-theoretic and mereological part---which we may
designate as \textepsilon -part and $m$-part. We may then take one
object to be an \textepsilon ,$m$-part of another if it is an
\textepsilon -part or an $m$-part or an $m$-part of an \textepsilon
-part or an \textepsilon -part of an $m$-part, or an $m$-part of an
\textepsilon -part of an $m$-part, and so on. More generally, if $K$
is a family of specific ways of being a part, we may take an object to
be a {\em K-part} of another if $x$ and $y$ can be linked by
relationships of $k$-part for $k$ in $K$ \citep[579]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

My hand is a \textepsilon ,$m$-part of my singleton, but not a
\textepsilon -part.

By conjoining every way of being a part, we arrive at the most general
notion of part:

\begin{squote}
Among the hybrid relations of part, of special interest is the
relation of $K$-part where $K$ is the family of {\em all} the specific
ways of being a part.  This is the relation of $K$-part that holds
between two objects when they may be linked by relationships of
$k$-part without restriction on $k$.  We might call it the {\em
  general} relation of part, and it is a relation that holds between
$x$ and $y$ whenever $x$ is in any way whatever a part of $y$
\citep[580]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

\subsection{Generating kinds}
\label{generate}
On this theory, what kind a thing is depends on what operation
produced it.  If a chair or a dogbush is a mereological sum, then this
is because they are produced by the summation operation.  The Dunn
family is `produced' by the family operation.  Groups are produced by
the group operation (see section \ref{group}).

But there is a difficulty to be avoided here.  As we saw in section
\ref{classical}, the mereological sum of a single thing $x$ is just
$x$.  Therefore there is a sense in which every physical thing,
including every simple, is a mereological sum, for the application of
the summation operation would just produce that thing.  To avoid this
consequence Fine introduces the notion of a {\em generative}
application of an operation:

\begin{squote}
We might say that the application $y = \Gamma (x_1, x_2, x_3,
\mathellipsis )$ of an operation $\Gamma$ is {\em generative} if there
is an explanation of the identity of $y$ as $\Gamma (x_1, x_2, x_3,
\mathellipsis )$; and we might say that the operation $\Gamma$ is
itself {\em generative} if it permits a generative application. Thus
both the set-builder and the operation of predication will be
generative in this sense \citeyearpar[582]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

Whether or not the summation operation is generative depends on the
things it is being applied to.  When summing a dog and a tree, it is
generative; when summing a dog by itself, it is not.

For any operation, there will be things it applies to that it cannot
produce.  The summation operator fuses simples, but cannot produce
them; the set-builder combines many things that it cannot produce
(like letters).  For any given operation, there is a `level 0'
consisting of the things that the operator itself cannot produce:

\begin{squote}
We suppose that certain objects are simply given.  These are the
objects whose identity does not require an explanation in terms of
$\Gamma$.  Thus, when $\Gamma$ is the set-builder, they are the
objects that are not sets and, when $\Gamma$ is summation, they are
the objects that are not sums or, rather, the objects that do not need
to be seen as sums.

We now `generate' objects in stages.  At stage 0 are the givens; at
stage 1, we add the objects that result from a single application of
the generative operation $\Gamma$ to the givens \citep[583]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

An application can now be identified as generative in a strong or a
weak sense:

\begin{description}
  \item[Strong generative application] Also called `strict' by Fine, a
    ``[strong] generative application of $\Gamma$ to the objects $x_1,
    x_2, \mathellipsis$ can now be defined as one in which $y = \Gamma
    (x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis )$ is of a higher level than each of
    $x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis$'' \citeyearpar[584]{fine2010}.  For
    example, summing the simples $x$ and $y$ to produce the fusion $z$
    would be a strong generative application of the summation
    operator; the simples are level 0 and $z$ is level 1.  Summing two
    composites, or a composite and a simple, would not be strongly
    generative; one or both of the parts would be the same level (1)
    as the product.
  \item[Weak generative application] To illuminate this notion Fine
    introduces another, that of a {\em putative generative
      application}: ``Let us say, in the first place, that $y = \Gamma
    (x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis )$ is a putative generative application
    of $\Gamma$ if $y$ is of a higher or of the same level as each of
    $x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis$.  This gives us the notions of a
    putative prior component and of a putative prior in the usual way.
    We now say that the application $y = \Gamma (x_1, x_2,
    \mathellipsis )$ of $\Gamma$ is a {\em weak} generative
    application if it is the putative generative application and if
    $y$ is not putatively prior to any of $x1, x2, \mathellipsis$.  We
    can get from $x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis$ to $y$ without an ascent in
    level but not from $y$ to any of $x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis$''
    \citeyearpar[584]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

Applying the summation operator to a simple is neither strongly nor
weakly generative.  It is not strongly generative because the result
is a simple, which is at level 0---the same level as its part
(itself).  It is not weakly generative because the result of the
operation is putatively prior to its parts.

\section{Groups and sets}
\label{group}
Fine's theory gives us the resources to define new composition
operators, and so new {\em kinds} of things.  But there is no point in
defining a composition operator for a kind of thing that does appear
in the world.  For example, suppose that unicorns are a special kind
of thing.  We could, presumably, define their existence conditions and
define a `unicorn-builder'---a composition operator for unicorns.  But
there are no unicorns, so why should we.  If we are to define a kind
of thing, we should first determine that there are such things.  One
kind of thing that does seem to have instances, unlike {\em unicorn},
is {\em group}.

Why should we think that there are groups, in addition to sets?  One
important reason is the apparent fact that groups can change their
parts, while sets cannot.  If groups are distinct from sets, we should
be able to define a group-builder that is distinct from a set-builder.
However, one new composition operator---the `group-builder'---will not
be enough.  We will see that, if we wish to introduce groups, we will
have to introduce many {\em kinds} of groups.  Fine's theory of parts
allows us to do this, but it is not clear that we ought to.  For it
may be that every group will be itself a {\em unique} kind of thing.

If we wish to avoid this conclusion, we may have to reject parts of
Fine's theory and place a limit on the kinds of things there are.  But
there are costs on both approaches.

\subsection{Motivating groups}
The set-builder, on Fine's theory, takes things (such as jurists) and
produces a set composed of them.  There is a set $S$ composed of the
2004 Supreme Court justices:

\begin{squote}
$S = \sum _{\in}$ (Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy,
  Souter, Thomas, \\ Ginsburg, Breyer) $ = $ \{Rehnquist, Stevens,
  O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, \\ Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer\}
\end{squote}

But some claim that, in addition to sets, there are also {\em groups}.
There may, in addition to the set \{Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor,
Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer\}, a group
containing the very same people.

One might ask why this is necessary.  Groups, it might be objected,
are really no different than sets.  When we speak of a group of
people, we are actually referring to the set of which they are
members.

But there are some reasons why it seems incorrect to identify groups
with sets.  Take the Supreme Court.  It seems that any attempt to
identify the Supreme Court with the set of the Supreme Court justices
will not succeed.  This is because the membership of the Supreme Court
changes over time, while the members of a set do not.  The set
containing the 1990 justices is a {\em different} set from the set
containing the 2012 justices, but the 2012 Supreme Court is not a
different entity than the 1990 Court.  (We may of course say things
like ``it's a different court now'', but by that we mean only that it
is composed of different people, and so may rule differently---note
that we do {\em not} say ``it's a different Court now''.)

If one grants that groups such as the Supreme Court are not sets, it
may be objected that they are therefore simply mereological sums.  But

\begin{squote}
membership in the Supreme Court is very different from
the part-whole relation on material objects.  The part-whole relation
on material objects is a transitive relation.  Thus if one identified
the Supreme Court with a material object and Justice Breyer with a
part of it, then one would be forced to conclude that Justice Breyer's
arm must be a part of the Supreme Court as well.  Yet, it is plain
that Justice Breyer's arm is neither a part nor a member of the
Supreme Court \citep[136--137]{uzquiano2004a}.
\end{squote}

If the Supreme Court were a mereological sum, it would behave very
strangely.  What its parts would be on a given occasion would depend
on the appointment decisions of the President.  (If we accept a
`four-dimensional' version of universalism, then objects have {\em
  temporal} as well as spatial parts.  There would then be a
mereological sum of the parts of the justices that existed during
their appointments.  This would be an object whose existence would not
depend on the President.)

There is at least some motivation to posit a new {\em kind} of thing
that is not a set or a sum.  This new kind is the group.
Unfortunately, once we try to spell out the identity conditions of
groups, we will see that groups are not one kind of thing: there are
many different kinds of things (possibly an infinite number of kinds
of things) that we lump under the term `group'.  

%% If we are to maintain that there are groups (that are not sets), we
%% will be committed to there being a plurality of kinds of things,
%% united under a family resemblance.

\subsection{The place of the group in Fine's template}
\label{group-temp}
In section \ref{classical} above, Kit Fine showed how the summation
operator relates to four different properties: Collapse, Leveling,
Absorption, and Permutation.

\begin{description}
  \item[Absorption] $\sum (\mathellipsis, x, x, \mathellipsis,
    \mathellipsis, y, y, \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis = \sum (
    \mathellipsis, x, \mathellipsis, y, \mathellipsis )$;
\item[Collapse] $\sum (x) = x$;
\item[Leveling] $\sum (\mathellipsis, \sum (x, y, z, \mathellipsis ),
  \mathellipsis, \sum (u, v, w, \mathellipsis ), \mathellipsis ) \\ =
  \sum (\mathellipsis, x, y, z, \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis, u, v, w,
  \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis )$;
\item[Permutation] $\sum (x, y, z, \mathellipsis ) = \sum (y, z, x,
  \mathellipsis )$ (and similarly for all other permutations)
  \citep[573]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

Sums have all four properties, while sets have only Permutation and
Absorption.  We can begin to define our group operator by thinking
about which of these properties it has.

I tentatively suggest that groups mimic sets with regard to these
four properties.  Groups possess Absorption due to the fact that one
cannot be twice a member of the same group.  Groups possess
Permutation, since there is no `order' with regard to membership of a
group (there may be {\em temporal} order---I joined the group
first!---but that is not the same thing).  Groups do not possess
Collapse, since (I am inclined to think) a group can have a single
member without thereby {\em being} that member.  If, for example, a
task force is created and only one individual assigned to it, the
findings of the task force will be of the {\em task force} and not of
the individual.  Groups do not possess Leveling either, since there
can be groups made up of groups.

%% So far we have seen that groups are quite similar to sets.  But there
%% are some differences.  As we have seen, groups can change their
%% membership, while sets cannot.  Additionally, I suggest that the
%% application conditions (see section \ref{fine-app}) for groups is
%% different from that of sets.  While sets can have more or less
%% anything as members (letters, people, other sets), I propose that {\em
%%   groups may be composed only of living things and other groups}.

%% This claim is made on intuitive grounds.  It simply seems odd to talk
%% about a group of rocks, or a group of sets.  Talk of groups implies
%% some sort of activity, and so it is more natural to use `group' to
%% refer to people and other animals.  Even a `group' of trees is not
%% wholly bizarre.  And a group---for example, the Special Committee on
%% Judicial Ethics---might be part of another group---the Committee of
%% Ethics Committees \citep[145]{uzquiano2004a}.

%% Another point on application conditions: I think that group
%% composition is {\em unrestricted} among living things and groups.
%% That is, for any set of living things and/or groups, there is a
%% group of them.  Any restriction seems arbitrary.

\subsection{How do groups change their members?}
\label{group-time}
The most important apparent difference between sets and groups is that
while the members of a set are necessarily so, the members of a group
may change over time.  How does this work?

We could think of the group composition operator (the group-builder)
as operating {\em not} on things (living things and groups) but on
things-at-times.  The group-builder for the Supreme Court takes the
various justices during the times of their service and produces the
group---the Supreme Court---from those people-at-times.

One problem with this proposal is that it appears to presuppose {\em
  temporal parts}.  For if the group-builder works in similar fashion
to the set-builder and summation operator, then it operates on {\em
  things}.  If our group-builder is going to operate on
people-at-times, then we seem to commit ourselves to the claim that
people-at-times are {\em things}.  And what things could they be but
temporal parts of other things?

Thinking of groups as being composed of things-at-times rather than
things is unintuitive in any case.  Sandra Day O'Connor \emph{was} a
member of the Supreme Court.  Taking temporal parts seriously would
require us saying instead that her 1981--2006 part \emph{is} a member
of the Supreme Court.  But Sandra Day O'Connor is no longer a member
{\em at all}.

If we don't want to presuppose temporal parts, the group operator has
to be somehow \emph{dynamic}. It can't just take things, compose them
and be done---it has to \emph{add and remove things over time}.

Making sense of a dynamic group operator might allow us to avoid
presupposing {\em eternalism} as well (ultimately it will not).  If
the group-builder made the Supreme Court `in one go', then future
justices would have to already exist in some sense.  How else could
the group-builder operate on them?

The most readily apparent way of making sense of a dynamic operator is
by relativizing the group-builder to times.  We can think of the
operator as taking a set at a time and producing a group: $G = \sum
_{t} (S)$.  (There are two interpretations of $\sum _{t}$: we might
say that the composition operator as (re-)producing a group at a
number of different times $t$, or we might say that there is a {\em
  different} composition operator at each time $t$.  I am not sure how
much depends on a choice here, but I will suppose that the former is
correct.)

Following \citet{uzquiano2004a}, we can say that set $S$
composes group $G$ at time $t$ if and only if:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
  \item $\forall x\ (x \in S \leftrightarrow x\ \text{is a member of}\ G
  \  @\ t)$
  \item $\exists x {[} x\ \text{is a member
      of}\ G\ @\ t\ \wedge\ \square ( x \in S )\ \wedge
    \\ \diamond\ \exists t^{\prime} ( G\ \text{exists}\ @
    \ t^{\prime}\ \wedge\ \neg ( x\ \text{is a member
      of}\ G\ @\ t^{\prime} )) {]}\ \vee \\ \exists x^{\prime} {[}
    \neg ( x^{\prime}\ \text{is a member of}\ G\ @\ t)\ \wedge \\ \neg
    \diamond (x^{\prime} \in S ) \wedge \ \diamond \exists t^{\prime
      \prime} (x^{\prime} \text{is a member of}\ G\ @\ t^{\prime
      \prime}) {]}$\ \citeyearpar[150]{uzquiano2004a}
\end{enumerate}

I will assume that group composition is {\em unrestricted}.  That is,
for any people and/or groups at any time $t$, there is a group
composed of them at that time.

\subsection{Identity conditions}
\label{group-id}
Given that groups can change their parts over time, there will be
cases in which $G = \sum _{t_1} ( S )$ and $G^{\prime} = \sum _{t_2}
( S^{\prime} )$ and $G = G^{\prime}$ and $t_1 \neq t_2$ and $S \neq
S^{\prime}$.  When will this occur?  Under what conditions does $G =
G^{\prime}$?

For example, $t_1$ might be 2004, $t_2$ might be 2012, $S$ might be
\{Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas,
Ginsburg, Breyer\} and $S^{\prime}$ might be \{Roberts, Stevens,
O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer\}.  If we
suppose that $G$ is the Supreme Court in 2004 and that $G^{\prime}$
is the Supreme Court, then we want to be able to say that $G =
G^{\prime}$.  

It may appear that we have hit a snag, however, For as Uzquiano points
out, a set of people can compose more than one group at a time.
Suppose that all and only the members of the Supreme Court in 2004 are
part of the Special Committee on Judicial Ethics.  In this case ``the
Supreme Court share[s] all of its members with the Special Committee
on Judicial Ethics as of a certain time [2004]''
\citep[151]{uzquiano2004a}.  It seems false to say that, in 2004, the
Supreme Court was identical with the Special Committee.  But if the
Supreme Court, $G$, is $\sum _{t} ( S )$ and the Special Committee,
$C$, is also $\sum _{t} ( S )$, then how can we deny that $G = C$?

%% One way is to allow that the group-builder can produce numerically
%% distinct groups from repeated applications of the same operation.

One proposal would be to look at the past and future histories of $G$
and $C$.  The Supreme Court is composed of $S^{\prime}$ in 2012, while
the Special Committee has been dissolved.  But I do not see how we can
appeal to identity across time without assuming eternalism.  If we
assume eternalism, we can say that $G = \sum ( \mathellipsis , \sum
_{2004}(S), \sum _{2012}(S^{\prime}), \mathellipsis )$.  But if we do
not assume eternalism, we will have to use temporal operators like
\textsc{was} and \textsc{will}.  We can therefore say only that
\textsc{was}($G = \sum (S)$), $G = \sum (S^{\prime})$ and
\textsc{will}($G = \sum (S^{\prime \prime})$).  We are still left with
its being presently the case that $G = C$.

What we {\em can} do is look at {\em possible} past and future
histories.  That is, we can appeal to the modal properties of the two
groups.  Recall Fine's discussion of the {\em character} conditions of
composition operators (section \ref{material}).  The characteristics,
or properties, of a thing will vary depending on the composition
operator used to produce it.  These properties may include modal
properties.  Different composition operators will produce things with
different modal properties.  Whatever members a set has, it has
necessarily; but a group may possibly have different members.  This is
because groups and sets are produced by means of different operators.

If we want the Supreme Court and the Special Committee to be distinct,
then we can assign them different modal properties.  But there is no
reason to restrict ourselves to modal properties.  The Supreme Court
and the Special Committee differ in many ways: the Supreme Court has
the power to interpret the Constitution, while the Special Committee
can issue reports on judicial ethics.  These different properties
correspond to differences in the character conditions of the two
groups.

But in order to have different character conditions, the Supreme Court
and the Special Committee must be produced by means of different
operators.  The Supreme Court will be the product of some operator
$\sum _{sc}$ and the Special Committee of $\sum _{sp}$.  And since
these two things are the products of different operators, they need
not be identical.

But just as sets and sums are different kinds of things, so the
Supreme Court and the Special Committee must now be recognized as not
merely different groups, but as different {\em kinds}.  There may be a
greater resemblance between their two kinds than there is between
things like sums and sets, but ultimately they have been estranged.
Calling both `groups' is simply categorizing both kinds under a common
label.

\subsection{The explosion of reality}
Is there anything wrong with this conclusion?  It does seem bizarre in
some ways.  For it is clear enough that one person (or group) may be a
member of an infinite number of groups; each of these `groups' will
therefore be a product of a different composition operator.  And each
will, strictly speaking, be a different kind of thing.

Previously we had a relatively tidy ontology.  There were sums, and
sets, and other well-known kinds; but now each task force or
subcommittee is potentially a kind unto itself.  Fine recognizes that
his approach ``will lead to an infinitude of forms of
composition\,\ldots a vast mereological firmament''
\citeyearpar[576]{fine2010}.  But he does not consider this to be a
drawback.

Perhaps my resistance is unwarranted, but I want to maintain that the
Supreme Court, the Special Committee, and everything else we call a
group is of one kind.  This cannot be maintained in Fine's
mereological firmament.  So I wish to re-examine the thesis that
groups---all of them---really are identical with sets.  This will lead
to some strange consequences, but it may be that they are {\em less}
strange than the `explosion of reality' that we otherwise face.

\subsection{Re-examining the set identity thesis}
\label{set-id}
The primary motivation cited above for positing groups was the fact
that the Supreme Court changes its members over time.  For example,
both of the following sentences are true:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
  \item The Supreme Court ruled on Roe vs.\ Wade in 1973. \label{roe1}

  \item The set of justices now serving as Supreme Court Justices did
    not rule on Roe vs.\ Wade in 1973
    \citep[135]{uzquiano2004a}. \label{roe2}
\end{enumerate}

One way to accommodate these facts is to ``insist that the Supreme
Court is a set, but to abandon the assumption that there is a single
set to which the phrase `the Supreme Court' refers in sentences
\ref{roe1} and \ref{roe2}'' \citep[138]{uzquiano2004a}.  To
successfully use the term `the Supreme Court' to refer to a set of
justices, there must be an implicit or explicit temporal reference.
If an utterance of \ref{roe1} is true it will be true because it the
speaker intends her audience to recognize her intention to refer to
the set of justices that was the Supreme Court in 1973.  If her
audience, for whatever reason, takes her to be referring to the
current Court, then they will evaluate \ref{roe1} as false.

Considered in this light, `the Supreme Court' is used to express a
relation between sets and times; ``$x$ is the Supreme Court at $t$''
\citep[140]{uzquiano2004a}.  There is some precedent for this sort of
interpretation:

\begin{squote}
Our use of the phrase `the Supreme Court' to express a relation a set
of justices bears to a time is much like our use of the phrase `the
president of the United States' to express a relation an individual
bears to a time.  Different persons may be the president of the United
States at different times, but there is at most one person that bears
that relation to each time \citep[138]{uzquiano2004a}.
\end{squote}

``But,'' it will be objected, ``there is an important difference here.
We use both terms---`the Supreme Court' and `the president'---to refer
to a past, present or future set that `is' the thing, but we also use
`the Supreme Court' to refer to {\em the Supreme Court}, which has
changed its membership over time.  If I say, `the Supreme Court has
become more conservative over the past century', there is no one set I
am referring to.  I must be referring to something else; the obvious
candidate is the {\em group} that is the Court.''

One reply here is to claim that all that what ``the Supreme Court has
become more conservative over the past century'' actually means is
that the members of the sets that have been the Supreme Court have
become more conservative.  Another, similar reply is that someone who
utters ``the Supreme Court has become more conservative over the past
century'' is saying something literally false (either because there is
no unique set that is being referred to, or because there is a unique
set referred to, but one that does not make the proposition true), but
can generally be understood to mean something else; namely, that the
members of the sets that have been the Supreme Court have become more
conservative.

Neither reply is {\em very} unintuitive; indeed, there is something
attractive about a thesis that reserves application of adjectives like
`conservative' for people, rather than other things like groups.

But there is a more pressing worry for the set identity thesis.
Recall that the set that is the Supreme Court at a given time might
also be the Special Committee on Judicial Ethics.  We must admit that
the Supreme Court in 2004 is the set \{Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor,
Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer\}, and the Special
Committee in 2004 is that very same set.  But now we are committed to
this argument:

\begin{enumerate}[ref=(\arabic*)]
  \item The Special Committee on Judicial Ethics is one of the
    committees assembled by the Senate.

  \item The Special Committee on Judicial Ethics is identical with the
    Supreme Court.

  \item {\em Therefore} the Supreme Court is one of the committees
    assembled by the
    Senate. \citep[144]{uzquiano2004a} \label{sup-com}
\end{enumerate}

And \ref{sup-com} seems false.

But it may be possible to argue that \ref{sup-com} is not false but
only {\em misleading} (indeed, very misleading).  For it
(conversationally) implies that future sets referred to by `the
Supreme Court' will be identical to future sets referred to by `the
Special Committee'.  And it is {\em this} that is certainly false.

\subsection{Set membership and literal speech}
\label{implicate}
Suppose we arrive at a meeting of the Special Committee on Judicial
Ethics.  Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter,
Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer are sitting around a center table.  As we
take our seats you turn to me and say, ``they look rather familiar,
don't they?''  I say ``that's also the Supreme Court.''

What am I referring to with the demonstrative expression ``that''?  If
one thinks that I am referring to a {\em group}---the Special
Committee---that is distinct from the Supreme Court, my utterance will
have to be interpreted as non-literal.  I will have to be understood
to mean that the {\em members} of the Special Committee are also the
members of the Supreme Court.  (On the other hand, if I am referring
to the {\em set} of justices, what I said is literally true.)

Suppose instead that you ask me who the members of the Special
Committee are.  I say ``Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy,
Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer.  The Special Committee is just
the Supreme Court.''  Here again one could argue that I am speaking
non-literally; what I mean is that the members of the Special
Committee are just the members of the Supreme Court.  (But if the
Supreme Court and the Special Committee are just sets---the same
set---I have again said something literally true.)

Now suppose that the Special Committee is dissolved in 2004.  In 2005,
we see the members of the Supreme Court (still Rehnquist, Stevens,
O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer) out
to lunch together.  I point and say ``that was the Special Committee
on Judicial Ethics.''  Now what is the referent of ``that''?  It
cannot be the Special Committee, for that has ceased to be.  It must
either be the Supreme Court or the set \{Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor,
Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer\}.  Either way,
the proponent of groups will have to interpret this utterance as
non-literal.  (The set-identity theorist can interpret this utterance
as literally true, however; that set was the Special Committee before
the dissolution.)

Now suppose that the Special Committee is dissolved in 2004 and
Rehnquist retired before dying in 2005 (let's pretend he retired in
May).  Now in August we see Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia,
Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer out to lunch together.
I point and say ``that was the Supreme Court {\em and} the Special
Committee on Judicial Ethics.''  I can only be referring to the set of
justices.  Why not suppose that I have only {\em ever} been referring
to the set of justices?  If I am in fact referring to the set
\{Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas,
Ginsburg, Breyer\}, then when I say ``that was the Supreme Court {\em
  and} the Special Committee'', I say something literally true.

I also say something literally true when I say ``the Supreme Court is
one of the committees assembled by the Senate'' or ``the Supreme Court
is the Special Committee on Judicial Ethics''.  But it is very
misleading to say either.  By saying ``the Supreme Court is the
Special Committee'' I imply that future referents of `the Supreme
Court' will be identical to future referents of `the Special
Committee'.  It is less misleading to say ``the current Supreme Court
is the Special Committee on Judicial Ethics''.  (It is even less
misleading to say ``the current Supreme Court is also the Special
Committee''.)

We use `the Supreme Court' sometimes to refer (whether literally or
non-literally) to more than one set.  When I say ``the Supreme Court
has become more diverse'' I mean that the members of the sets that
have been the Supreme Court have become more diverse.  It may be due
to this fact that we so easily misinterpret uttered propositions like
``the Supreme Court is the Special Committee''.  A listener might take
this to mean that the members of the sets that have been the Supreme
Court are identical with the members of the sets that have been the
Special Committee.  They would therefore evaluate the utterance as
false.

I have tried to show here that by identifying groups with sets, we can
interpret some talk as literal rather than non-literal.  I think this
is a good thing.  But it will be objected that the set identity thesis
forces us to interpret a great deal of {\em other} talk as
non-literal, talk which is commonly thought of as literal.  Take, for
example, ``the Supreme Court has become more conservative''.  If we
claim that the Supreme Court is a set, we cannot interpret this
utterance as literally true; {\em sets} do not have political
leanings.  Someone who utters this, according to the set identity
thesis, must be taken to mean that the members of the sets that have
been the referents of ``the Supreme Court'' have become more
conservative.

But can the advocate of groups interpret this literally?  Can groups
{\em literally} have political leanings?  Or must the speaker be
interpreted as meaning that the members of the group have become more
conservative?  I think it is plausible that ``the Supreme Court has
become more conservative'' must be interpreted as non-literal, whether
the Supreme Court is a group or a set.

What about an utterance such as ``the Supreme Court ruled against the
defendant''?  If the Supreme Court is a set, this utterance will have
to be interpreted as non-literal.  Sets don't {\em do} things; we will
have to interpret the speaker as meaning that the Supreme Court
justices ruled against the defendant.  But what if the Court was
divided over the ruling?  If several justices wrote dissenting
opinions, it seems that {\em they} didn't rule against the defendant.
Rather, we want to say that the {\em group} ruled against the
defendant.  The proponent of groups may be in a slightly stronger
position here.  But if we identify the Supreme Court with a set, we
can still say that the {\em majority} of the Supreme Court justices
ruled against the defendant.  And that is more or less what we mean
when we say ``the Supreme Court ruled against the defendant''.

Whether we identify the Supreme Court with a group or a set, we will
have to interpret certain talk as non-literal.  This should not worry
us.  It is likely that much of our talk {\em is} non-literal (see
\citet{bach1987}).  For example, we may have to interpret ``the chair
is mine'' as non-literal, because it might be that ``the chair is
mine'' entails that there is only one chair in the world.  Even
propositions involving proper names might be non-literal.  If `Alex'
designates every person named `Alex', then ``Alex is lying down''
might be literally false because it entails either that there is only
one `Alex' or that every `Alex' is lying down.

Whether or not we identify the Supreme Court and other groups with
sets, we will have to interpret some apparently literal speech as
non-literal.  So the set identity thesis should not be dismissed
because of considerations about literal speech.

\subsection{Conventional identity conditions}
\label{set-convention}
Even supposing everything above is right, there is still more to be
said.  What are the `identity conditions' for the Supreme Court over
time?  Although the Supreme Court is a set, we use `the Supreme Court'
to refer to different sets at different times.  What governs this
shifting reference?  What makes it true that one set is the Supreme
Court in 2004 and a different set is in 2012?

What makes it true that a given set is the Supreme Court at a given
time is simply our legal conventions.  The Constitution authorizes the
recognition of a set of justices as `the Supreme Court'.  Which set is
recognized as the Supreme Court is decided by the legislative and
executive branches.  The president nominates a set (the sitting
justices and the nominated justice) and the legislative branch votes.
The outcome of the vote make it true or false that a given set is the
Supreme Court.

(Now what do we mean when we say ``the Supreme Court was established
in 1789''?  Perhaps that the convention of referring to a set of
justices as `the Supreme Court'---and the granting of legal powers to
them---began in 1789.)

This is analogous for all `groups'.  Teams, bands, militias---what
makes it true that a certain set is a team, band or militia is just
the conventions governing the group.  If I desert my militia and the
other members of the militia recognize my absence as a desertion, then
it is understood that I am no longer part of the militia; for that
reason it is then true that the set containing me is no longer the
militia.  A smaller set, not containing me, is now the militia.

It seems, then, that {\em `identity' conditions over time for groups
  are wholly conventional}.  This is plausible; groups are social
entities, and it makes sense that their composition should be a matter
of social convention.  But if this is true, it suggests something more
radical: that identity conditions over time for physical objects like
chairs are conventional as well.

\section{The conventions of ordinary things}
Recall how Fine defined the summation operator of classical
mereology (section \ref{classical}:

\begin{displaymath}
\sum _m (\mathellipsis , x, y, z, \mathellipsis )
\end{displaymath}

The identity conditions for sums is {\em regular}: sums $A$ and $B$
are identical if and only if the summation operation that produced $A$
took the same things---{\em other than sums}---as variables
($\mathellipsis , x, y, z, \mathellipsis $) as did the operation that
produced $B$.  In other words, if mereological sums are ultimately
composed of partless atoms (`simples'), then two sums are identical if
and only if they share all the same simples.

There is an obvious parallel between the current conception of sums
and that of sets.  Neither sets nor mereological sums, so conceived,
can change their parts.

Ordinary things like statues, however, {\em can} apparently change
their parts.  If I break the nose of my statue, I can replace it.  Do
I thereby have a new statue?  It seems I do not; rather, I have fixed
my old statue.

At this point one might say that statues are therefore not
mereological sums, and posit a type of entity that includes statues
and {\em can} change its parts over time.  Perhaps a statue would then
be composed by a sum at a time.  We could relativize the composition
operator for statues to times.  This would be parallel to our
treatment of groups above (section \ref{group-time}).  The
`object-builder' would then be an operator that takes sums at times
and produces an object---in this case, a statue: $O = \sum _{t} ( S
)$.

But having divorced the statue from the sum that composes it, trouble
arises.  For seems plausible that a sum (at a time) might compose more
than one object.  Just as the set \{Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor,
Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer\} composed both the
Supreme Court and the Special Committee on Judicial Ethics in 2004, so
the sum $S$ might compose the statue and the lump of clay.  Just as
the Supreme Court has different powers and a different history than
the Special Committee, so the statue and the lump have (apparently)
different properties and histories.  The statue cannot survive a
squashing; the lump can.  The lump may have been formed on Monday; the
statue might not have come into being until Tuesday.

We might assume that the lump is also produced by means of the
object-builder: $O^{\prime} = \sum _{t} ( S )$.  But now we face the
same problems that plagued the time-relative group operator (section
\ref{group-id}).  Above, we produced the statue by means of the same
object-builder operation: $O = \sum _{t} ( S )$.  How can we deny that
$O = O^{\prime}$, that the statue is identical with the lump?

Just as with the Supreme Court and the Special Committee, the obvious
way to distinguish the statue and the lump is by reference to their
different properties (modal and otherwise).  Just as we produced the
Supreme Court and the Special Committee by means of different
operators, so we can introduce separate composition operators to build
the statue and the lump.  The statue will be the product of the
statue-builder $\sum _{st}$ and the lump the lump-builder $\sum
_{lump}$.

But the same problems arise.  Having the Supreme Court and the Special
Committee be the products of different operators means that they are
different {\em kinds} of things---to say that both are `groups' is
simply to bring two heterogeneous kinds under one label.  Likewise, the
statue and the lump are different kinds of things---to say that both
are `physical objects' is simply to bring two heterogeneous kinds
under one label.

And just as we faced an `explosion of reality' after allowing the
proliferation of `groups', so again we face an explosion of `physical
things' with different properties.  Since we have allowed that the
statue and the lump may be different things composed of the same sums,
why stop there?  We can introduce more composition operators that
produce distinct objects.  Where we see a statue and a lump, why not
suppose that there is an infinity of objects, each of a different kind
and with slightly different properties?

This is not a particularly attractive position, but it is not
indefensible (see \citet[section 4]{bennett2004}).  Since we have
already allowed a plurality of scattered objects like archipelagos and
dogbushes, why not allow a plurality of co-located objects?

I do not think I can rule out this possibility, but I think there is
another option that has some plausibility.  Just as we found a way to
identify groups with sets, and so shrink the ``mereological
firmament'', so can we identify ordinary things with sums.

\subsection{Referring to chairs}
\label{chair-ref}
Just as we identified groups like the Supreme Court with different
sets at different times, so we can identify things like chairs with
different sums at different times.  Terms like `chair' will be used to
express a relation between a sum and a time.

This will of course have the consequence that, at $t_1$, the statue is
identical with the lump of clay.  This will be true, since they are
both the set $S$.  The statue {\em is} the lump of clay.  This seems
correct.  If someone were to ask ``I see the statue, but where did the
lump of clay go?'' we would reply, ``the statue {\em is} the lump''.

If we feel tempted to say that the statue is not identical with the
lump, this is because future (and {\em possible}) utterances of
`statue' may not be used to refer to the same sum as future utterances
of `lump'.  (Thus we can account for their apparent modal differences
as well.)

The identification of statues (and lumps) with sums allows us to
explain some sorts of talk that would be otherwise problematic.  For
example, suppose I make a statue out of a lump of clay.  You come
along and squish the statue (thereby destroying it):

\stage{Alex}{}{That was my statue!}

If we thought that the statue was a distinct thing from the sum (and
from the lump), we would have to interpret what I say non-literally.
For if the statue was a distinct thing that has been destroyed, then
when I use a demonstrative like ``that'' I cannot be referring to the
non-existence statue.  My audience may interpret me as referring to
the lump, and meaning that there used to be a statue co-located with
the lump.  But if we suppose that the statue was not a distinct thing
from the sum (and from the lump), then what I said is literally true.
For ``that''---that sum---was a statue, but is no longer.  It is no
longer a statue because it no longer satisfies our conventional
criteria for what counts as a statue.  (You could dispute these
criteria; after I say ``that was my statue'', you could say ``it still
is your statue; it's just a flatter statue than it was''.)

So like the identity of groups over time, the identity over time of a
given thing---like my chair---will be conventional.

But this does not mean that {\em I} have the final say over how my
chair persists through time.  The identity over time of the Supreme
Court is conventional, but it is not up to me.  There are entrenched
legal conventions governing the persistence of the Supreme Court.
Likewise, for different things, different conventions will govern
their persistence.  Recall Rosenberg's discussion of the problem with
van Inwagen's Special Composition Question (section \ref{lessons-v}).
He rejected the idea that there is just one way in which `material
objects' are composed:

\begin{squote}
Microphysics explains how protons, neutrons, and electrons compose
different species of atoms, and physical chemistry, how atoms of
various species compose different sorts of molecules
\citep[706]{rosenberg1993}.
\end{squote}

I think it is plausible to claim that atoms, molecules, animals,
chairs, statues and lumps are, in fact, identical with sums.  If this
is correct, then there is really just {\em one} way in which these
things are composed.  But they {\em persist through time} in very
different ways; which sum is identical with a given animal, for
example, depends on the `conventions' of the biological sciences.

\subsection{Essentialism}
\label{essentialism}
This theory---the second of the two possible answers I mentioned at
the beginning of this section---is a version of {\em essentialism}.
Essentialism is the thesis that, strictly speaking, things don't
change their parts.  One can endorse or oppose essentialism in various
domains.  For example, everyone is a set essentialist; nobody (as far
as I know) claims that sets can change their parts.  But not everyone
is a {\em mereological} essentialist.

People who deny mereological essentialism are, I think, making one of
two claims:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item They may be claiming that ordinary things like chairs are not
    mereological sums; chairs can change their parts, so essentialism
    {\em with regard to chairs} is false.  A philosopher who makes
    this claim might allow that mereological sums, if there are such
    things, cannot change their parts.
  \item Or they might be claiming that mereological sums, whether or
    not they are identical with ordinary things like chairs, can
    change their parts.
\end{enumerate}

The first claim is probably more common (but see \citet{inwagen2006}
for a defense of the second).  But a philosopher who makes either
claim will reject the theory I have been building.  They will say that
my theory flies in the face of common sense (and I made so much of
common sense in ealier sections!).  They will say things like this:

\begin{squote}
According to [the essentialist], it is never literally correct to say
that a thing survives a change in parts.  This is a point of massive
departure from ordinary belief \citep[184]{sider2001}.
\end{squote}

This is more or less the argument against essentialism.  You point at
a chair and say ``I'm supposed to believe that if that chair loses
{\em one atom}, it's literally a different chair?''

The more emphasis one places on `literally', the more plausible
essentialism is.  ``Is it {\em literally} the same chair?  Well, it
lost a part, so it's not {\em exactly} the same chair.''

At this point the antagonist will claim that I am equivocating between
{\em descriptive} and {\em numerical} sameness.  Of course the chair
is {\em different}; it has lost a part and so has different
properties.  But the question is not whether {\em the} chair is
different; the question is whether there is a {\em different chair} in
place of the old chair.

Perhaps my intuitions are simply wrong, but I find some plausibility
in the idea that, {\em strictly speaking}, when a chair loses a part,
the later chair is descriptively {\em and} numerically distinct from
the chair that possessed the part.  Even if ``that's the same chair as
yesterday'' is literally false, the sum that yesterday satisfies the
criteria for being the referent of ``chair'' no longer satisfies those
criteria; a different sum that has many of the same parts now
satisfies those criteria, and so qualifies as `the same chair'.  (How
similar the two sums has to be is, again, a conventional matter.)

Maybe I am wrong and it is true that (strictly speaking) the chair can
lose its parts and yet remain the (numerically) same chair.  If so,
then we must accept the mereological firmament that comes with Fine's
theory.

\subsection{Do we need Fine's theory at all?}
I have argued that we can identify ordinary things like chairs as
mereological sums, and we can identify things like groups as sets.  It
is therefore not necessary to use Fine's theory of parthood to
describe these things.  Do we need Fine's theory at all?

I think the theory is still useful.  For it shows that sums and sets
both have parts, but in different ways.  There are also sequences,
strings, and other things produced by various composition operators.
And there are other things that exist, like words, poems, events, and
quantities, that have parts in other ways.  Fine's theory may help us
define composition operators for these things, if they cannot be
described in terms of sets and sums (which I suspect they cannot be).

Fine's theory also suggests a novel way of describing temporal parts.
He claims that not all operators are compositional; some are {\em
  decompositional}.  He introduces the segmentation operation that
takes partless simples and produces their `parts'---the top and
bottom, left and right half, etc.  These `parts' are derived from the
wholes, rather than the wholes being built up from the parts:

\begin{squote}
Let us suppose that the universe consists of physical atoms which are
physically indivisible but of finite volume.  We might then
distinguish between the upper and lower parts of the atom (relative to
its orientation at a given time); and it is plausible that the atoms
are to be taken as givens, there being no explanation of their
identity in more basic terms, while the identity of the upper and
lower parts of an atom is to be explained in terms of their {\em
  being} the upper and lower parts of the atom.  Thus the account of
the part is in terms of the whole rather than the other way around
\citep[585]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

Likewise, if we maintain that objects are not {\em composed} of
temporal parts, but are `temporally indivisible', we can nonetheless
have a temporal-segmentation operator that generates temporal `parts'
from temporally `simple' wholes.  These parts would have theoretical
utility; we could quantify over them without committing ourselves to
their existence (in a `basic' sense).  This sort of derived temporal
part might allow for a form of four-dimensionalism (the conjunction of
universalism and the doctrine of temporal parts) that avoids the
`spinning disc' problem, among others.

So whether or not we accept the ``vast mereological firmament'' that
Fine envisions, his theory of part is useful.

%% \subsection{Are there lumpkins after all?}
%% \label{after}

\section{Lessons}
\label{lessons-p}
We have seen two different theories that account for the existence of
chairs.  They are very different, and neither is entirely
satisfactory.  However, I am not sure what the alternatives are.

The first theory is an application of Fine's theory of part.  On this
theory, there are chairs and statues and lumps, but they all are
different kinds of things.  If they are all `material things', this is
only because we group together the individual kinds that they belong
to.  This is not obviously wrong, but once we have admitted that the
same matter might compose a statue and a lump, we have trouble
resisting the idea that there might be {\em more} things, of other
kinds, composed of that same matter.  Where we might take there to be
one thing (or maybe two), we now seem committed to there being a huge
number of co-located things.

The second theory identifies chairs and other ordinary things with
mereological sums.  As I understand the concept, a sum is like a set
in that it does not change its parts.  Therefore when refer to `my
chair', I am referring to a sum.  If I replace the leg on my chair, I
henceforth use `my chair' to refer to a different sum.  Which sum I
refer to with `my chair' is governed by convention.

My conclusion is largely the same as that of Karen Bennett:

\begin{squote}
The only live options, then, are to be either a one-thinger or a
bazillion-thinger.  We must either think that there is only one thing per
spatio-temporal location, or else that there are lots and \emph{lots} of
spatio-temporally coincident things \citeyearpar[358]{bennett2004}.
\end{squote}

I would prefer to be a `one-thinger' because it does not commit me to
a `bazillion' things all in the same place.  That is not a decisive
objection, of course.  It may well be that such an explosion is more
plausible than certain consequences of the `one-thinger' theory.  But
I think one of the two theories must be right.

\subsection{Deflationary metaphysics}
\label{deflate}
Kathrin Koslicki has an interesting objection to universalist theses
such as the one I appear committed to.  Her objection amounts to this:
if every `collection' of objects (such as the London Bridge, a
particle in the moon, and Cal Ripkin, Jr.) is a thing in its own right
(a sum), then metaphysics becomes uninteresting.  There is no longer
any debate about whether chairs or dogbushes are more `real' or have a
stronger claim to existence.  They both (obviously) exist, and the
difference between chairs and lumpkins is not ontological but
conceptual: `chair' is more embedded in our talk, and so chairs have
greater importance to {\em us}.  But metaphysically, or ontologically,
chairs and dogbushes are on the same level.  There is no sense in
which chairs exist and lumpkins do not.

In the quoted material below, Koslicki is criticizing a version of
four-dimensionalism that Sider has previously defended.  Sider's
position was that any collection of objects-at-times is a thing in its
own right.  Sider calls these things `fusions'.  For example, a chair
is a fusion of a large number of {\em temporal part} of things (wood
molecules, or atoms, or simples).  Each thing (wood molecule, atom, or
simple) is a fusion of {\em its} temporal parts.  Each temporal part
of the chair is also a thing (a fusion).

I take no stance on whether objects have temporal parts or rather
`endure' through time.  Moreover, if we accept Fine's theory of parts
then we reject the idea that there is just one composition operation;
the operation that produces fusions is one among many.  But Koslicki's
comments are relevant nonetheless:

\begin{squote}
There is room, in Sider's theory, for {\em some} genuine ontological
disagreements: for example, the universalist, the nihilist and the
holder of the intermediary position genuinely disagree over how many
and which fusions that exist.  But the only genuine ontological
disagreements for which there is room, in Sider's world, are ones that
concern disagreements over `bare' fusions, so to speak.  What has
happened to the houses, trees, people, and cars, the familiar concrete
objects of common-sense, whose persistence this account set out to
analyze?  There are no `deep' ontological facts as to whether a given
fusion should count as a house or not\,\ldots

[By claiming that there can be genuine ontological disputes,] Sider is
guilty of a bit of false advertising: his account is really a way of
saying that, at the end of the day, there is no interesting {\em
  ontological} story to be told about the persistence of our familiar
concrete objects of common-sense; whatever there is to say about the
persistence of houses, trees, people and cars concerns the
organization of our conceptual household
\citeyearpar[124--125]{koslicki2003}.
\end{squote}

Koslicki seems to think that we ought to be able to find some
ontological difference between ``the familiar concrete objects of
common-sense'' and things like lumpkins or chairs-at-times.  But as I
remarked above (section \ref{universalism}), why should what interests
us (familiar objects like chairs) be a guide to what exists?  The
conclusion that ``the persistence [and other properties] of houses,
trees, people and cars concerns the organization of our conceptual
household'' seems to be correct.

However, there {\em is} an ontological difference between some things,
if not between chairs and dogbushes.  One lesson of Kit Fine's theory
of parts is that mereological sums are not the only kind of composite
thing.  There are sets as well, and strings, and sequences, and
perhaps infinitely many other types of thing.  The difference between
a set and a sum is an ontological difference.  Within each type,
however, we must rely on our own conceptual `scheme' to organize
things.

In section \ref{lessons-v} I considered Jay Rosenberg's claim that
the Special Composition Question is the wrong question to be asking.
Rosenberg's position seems to be that there is {\em no} answer to the
Special Composition Question.  Rather, he thinks what it takes to
`compose' something depends on what that something is---making a chair
is not like making a pie.

This insight of Rosenberg's can be connected with the insights of
Fine's theory.  If we understand `composition' in the Special
Composition Question to mean {\em mereological composition}, then
Rosenberg was wrong if he held that there is no correct answer to the
Special Composition Question.  It seems intuitively true that
mereological composition is unrestricted.  But if take `composition'
in the Special Composition Question to be $K$-composition---any
composition operator at all---then Rosenberg was {\em right} that
there is no answer.  What the application conditions are for a
composition operator depends on {\em which} composition operation is
being applied.  

Moreover, determining the application conditions for these composition
operators, and determining their identity conditions, and determining
the other properties of these various operators is a task for
metaphysics.  The field is not then so barren as Koslicki seems to
have feared.  But it is true that many interesting questions---When
are we willing to call something a chair, and why?  What conditions
must be fulfilled?---are not ontological questions anymore.  They are
questions about our ``conceptual household.''
