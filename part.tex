\label{parts}

In the previous section I argued that not only are there ordinary
things like chairs, but that there are more unusual things like
archipelagos, scattered works of art, and perhaps even dogbushes.  I
tried to make it at least plausible to assume that some version of
{\em universalism} is true---that for any material things, there is
some material object made up of them.

But I also argued that in addition to this plurality of `material
objects', there are other {\em kinds} of things, such as teams,
families, and judicial bodies.  For example, in addition to the
material object made up of the justices on the Supreme Court, there is
also the Supreme Court itself.  The former thing is located at each
point at which the justices are located, but it seems odd to say that
the Supreme Court is a large, scattered object.  It is more natural to
say that the Court is a {\em group} of physical objects (the
justices), not a physical object itself.  The same goes for the Reed
College women's rugby team, and my family.  There is at least some
reason to recognize kinds of things in addition to material objects.

How, though, do these new kinds of things differ from material
objects?  The material object made up of the Supreme Court justices
and the Supreme Court itself appear to have the same parts: the
justices.  But we are supposing that they are not the same thing.  If
they do not differ in their parts, they must differ in some other way.

In this section we will assess several different theories.  These
theories have to do with how different kinds of things exist and how
they relate to their parts.  We will see that each theory, in order to
differentiate different kinds of things (like the material object made
up of the justices and the Supreme Court), has the consequence that
there are potentially {\em infinite} different kinds of things, and,
worse, potentially infinite kinds of things in any given location.

A theory that posits such {\em co-located objects} has some merits.
For example, some philosophers claim that a statue is an object
distinct from the clay of which it is made.  A problem for this view
is how to distinguish the statue from the clay, when both have the
same parts (the parallel with the Supreme Court and the justices is
obvious).  The theories that we will examine each solve this problem,
though in different ways.

There are, however, reasons to be suspicious of a theory that entails
such a `plurality' of kinds of objects.  The alternative, which I will
present in section \ref{essential}, is to maintain that there are only
a small number of kinds---just mereological sums and sets, perhaps.
Groups like the Supreme Court may be identified with sets, and
material objects like chairs may be identified with sums.  The
difficulty with this view is that sets do not change their parts over
time, and (given certain assumptions) neither do sums.

If we defend this `essentialist' answer, we will have to interpret
talk about `the same chair' over time as being talk about {\em
  different} sums over time.  The appearance of persistence over time
(and through change) is a product of {\em conventions} that govern
terms like `chair'.  What mereological sum is the referent of `the
chair' from one day to the next depends not upon the actual identity
of the two referents, but upon convention.

\section{Parthood and composition}
\label{parthood}
I argued in section \ref{plural-ref} that things like teams, crews,
and families are indeed {\em things}.  Terms like `team', `crew', and
`family' are not disguised references to plurals.  Moreover, things
like teams are things with {\em parts}.  The rugby players are each
{\em part} of the Reed College women's rugby team.  The team is made
up of---it is composed of---the players.

When I say that the players are part of the team, or that the
crewmembers are part of the crew, or that I am part of my family, is
that use of `part' the same as when I say that the tree is part of the
dogbush, or that the seat is part of the chair?  Are {\em any} of
these uses of `part' the same?

\subsection{Parthood and classical mereology}
\label{tech}
Technical notions of composition are often defined in terms of
parthood, which is itself left undefined.  Peter van Inwagen provides
the following definitions:

\begin{displaymath}
x\ \text{is a part of}\ y =_{df} x\ \text{is a proper part
  of}\ y\ \text{or}\ x = y
\end{displaymath}

It is assumed that everything is a part of itself.  A `proper part' of
some $x$ is a part that is not $x$ itself.

\begin{displaymath}
x\ \text{overlaps}\ y =_{df} \text{For some}\ z, z\ \text{is a part
  of}\ x\ \text{and}\ z\ \text{is a part of}\ y
\end{displaymath}

Just as everything is a part of itself, everything overlaps itself
(when $x = y = z$).

\begin{squote}
$x$ is a mereological sum of the $y$s $=_{df}$ For all $z$ (if $z$ is
  one of the $y$s, $z$ is a part of $x$) and for all $z$ (if $z$ is a
  part of $x$, then for some $w$, ($w$ is one of the $y$s and $z$
  overlaps $w$)) \citeyearpar[618--619]{inwagen2006}.
\end{squote}

The first part of this definition---``if $z$ is one of the $y$s, $z$
is a part of $x$''---specifies that all of the $y$s are part of $x$.
But we want to be able to say that all and {\em only} the $y$s are
part of $x$.  The second part of the definition---``if $z$ is a part
of $x$, then for some $w$, $w$ is one of the $y$s and $z$ overlaps
$w$''---gets us this, by specifying that every part of $x$ overlaps
one of the $y$s.

%% \begin{squote}
%% $x$ is a mereological sum $=_{df}$ For some $y$s, $x$ is a
%%   mereological sum of those $y$s.
%% \end{squote}

There are at least two limitations to this standard formulation of
mereology.  First, it entails that everything that has parts is a
mereological sum.  Second, it does not explain how, if at all,
mereological sums can change their parts.

\subsection{Is everything a mereological sum?}
\label{all-sum}
One problem with the standard formulations of mereology is that---like
van Inwagen's definitions above---they entail that everything that has
parts is a mereological sum.  And though it may be an unreflective
prejudice, I am inclined to believe that mereological sums are {\em
  physical}, or material, things.  Material things certainly have
parts, but they are not the only things:

\begin{squote}
The word `part' is applied to many things besides material objects.
We have already noted that submicroscopic objects like quarks and
protons are at least not clear cases of material objects;
nevertheless, every material object would seem pretty clearly to have
quarks and protons as \emph{parts}, and, it would seem, in exactly the
same sense of \emph{part} as that in which a paradigmatic material
object might have another paradigmatic material object as a part.  A
``part,'' therefore, need not be a thing that is clearly a material
object.  Moreover, the word `part' is applied to things that are
clearly \emph{not} material objects---or at least it is on the
assumption that these things really exist and that apparent reference
to them is not a mere manner of speaking.  A stanza is a part of a
poem; Botvinnik was in trouble for part of the game; the part of the
curve that lies below the x-axis contains two minima; parts of his
story are hard to believe\,\ldots\,such examples can be multiplied
indefinitely \citeyearpar[18--19]{inwagen1995}.
\end{squote}

Under our current conception of a mereological sum, things like poems
seem to be included.  For recall van Inwagen's definition:

\begin{squote}
$x$ is a mereological sum of the $y$s $=_{df}$ For all $z$ (if $z$ is
  one of the $y$s, $z$ is a part of $x$) and for all $z$ (if $z$ is a
  part of $x$, then for some $w$, ($w$ is one of the $y$s and $z$
  overlaps $w$)) \citeyearpar[618--619]{inwagen2006}.
\end{squote}

Stanzas are parts of the poem, as are lines, words, and letters.  For
simplicity's sake, though, let us pretend that only words are parts of
poems.  The $y$s are therefore all the words in a poem $x$.

Suppose $z$ is the word `bear'.  The word `bear' is a word in the
poem, so it is one of the $y$s.  The first part of van Inwagen's
definition tells us that `bear' is therefore part of the poem.  Now
take the second part of the definition.  We have established that $z$
(`bear') is part of $x$ (the poem), so the antecedent of the
conditional (``if $z$ is a part of $x$'') is true.  If the poem is a
mereological sum, then the consequent must also be true.  There must
be some one of the $y$s that overlaps $z$.  Since $z$ is one of the
$y$s, and everything overlaps itself, the consequent is true.

We can follow the same steps for every word in the poem.  It seems,
therefore, that poems are mereological sums.  Is this acceptable?

I can think of no principled reason to deny that poems in particular
are mereological sums, but there are good reasons to think that not
{\em everything} is a mereological sum.  This is because there are
some things that are correctly said to be parts of another thing, but
are apparently parts in a {\em different way} than are the parts of
mereological sums:

\begin{squote}
Now, on the face of it, there would appear to be a wide variety of
basic ways in which one object can be a part of another.  The letter
`n' would appear to be a part of the expression `no', for example, and
a particular pint of milk part of a particular quart; and if these two
relations of part are not themselves basic (perhaps through being
restricted to expressions or quantities), there would appear to be
basic relations of part that hold between `n' and `no' or the pint and
the quart.  It is also plausible that the way in which `n' is a part
of `no' is different from the way in which the pint is a part of the
quart.  For if the two ways were the same, then how could it be that
two pints were only capable of composing a single quart, while the two
letters `n' and `o' were capable of composing two expressions, `no'
and `on' \citep[562]{fine2010}?
\end{squote}

The parthood relation for sets is again different.  The set containing
the only the letters `n' and `o' has the letters as parts.  When the
letters are parts of a set, their order is irrelevant, but when the
letters are parts of a word, order matters; hence `no' and `on'.  The
parthood relation for sets is also different from the parthood
relation for quantities (of milk):

\begin{squote}
If four quarts compose a gallon the pints which compose the quarts
will compose the gallon in the same way in which they compose the
quarts, whereas, if four sets compose a further set the members of the
sets will not compose the further set in the same way in which they
compose the component sets.  Thus we would now appear to have three
different basic ways in which one object can be a part of another
(pint/gallon, letter/word, and member/set); and once these cases have
been granted, it is plausible that there will be many more
\citep[562]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

The standard mereology does not appear to be capable of handling the
parthood relation that applies to sets, or that which applies to
words.  But if these things (sets, words) have parts, and if they are
not sums, then the standard mereology is flawed, for it entails that
everything that has parts is a sum.

\subsection{Can mereological sums change their parts?}
\label{change}
Many philosophers believe that mereological sums cannot change their
parts.  Since many also believe that chairs and other ordinary things
{\em can} change their parts, concerns arise about the utility of
mereological sums.  If chairs and other ordinary things change their
parts, then they are not sums; what then {\em are} sums?

But not all philosophers do believe that sums cannot change their
parts.  Peter van Inwagen is one.  His argument is very
straightforward:  just as it follows from the definition of
`mereological sum' that things like poems are sums, so it follows that
things like chairs are sums.  Things like chairs can change their
parts.  Therefore, sums can change their parts.

This simple argument requires some supplementation, for there is an
(almost) equally simple argument that purports to show that sums {\em
  cannot} change their parts:

\begin{squote}
Consider an object $\alpha$ that is the mereological sum of $A$, $B$,
and $C$ (that is $\alpha = A + B + C$).  We suppose that $A$, $B$, and
$C$ are simples (that they have no proper parts), and that none of
them overlaps either of the others.  And let us suppose that nothing
{\em else} exists---that nothing exists besides $A$, $B$, $C$, $A +
B$, $B + C$, $A + C$, and $A + B + C$.  Now suppose that a little time
has passed since we supposed this, and that, during this brief
interval, $C$ has been annihilated (and that nothing has been created
{\em ex nihilo}).  Can it be that $\alpha$ still exists?  Well, here
is a complete inventory of the things that now exist: $A$, $B$, and $A
+ B$.  And $\alpha$ is none of these things, for, before the
annihilation of $C$, they existed and $\alpha$ existed and $\alpha$
was was not identical with any of them (all three of them were then
proper parts of $\alpha$).  And nothing can become identical with
something else: $x \neq y \rightarrow \square\ x \neq y$; a thing and
another thing cannot become a thing and itself.  We do not, in fact,
have to appeal to any modal principle to establish this conclusion,
for if $\alpha$ were (now) identical with, say, $A + B$, that identity
would constitute a violation of Leibniz's Law, since the object that
is both $\alpha$ and $A + B$ would both have and lack the property
``once having had $C$ as a part'' \citep[629]{inwagen2006}.
\end{squote}

Van Inwagen escapes this conclusion---that mereological sums cannot
change their parts---by denying that mereological composition is
unrestricted.  He denies that for any things, there is an object
composed of them.  In the example above, therefore, van Inwagen might
deny that, before the annihilation of $C$, there was a sum of $A + B$.
He would therefore be able to maintain that $\alpha$ loses a part,
going from $A + B + C$ to $A + B$.  There would be no preexisting $A +
B$ to compete with.

As I have argued in section \ref{universe}, I think unrestricted
composition---universalism---is true.  Therefore I cannot follow van
Inwagen's escape route, and I conclude that mereological sums, in
their standard formulation, cannot change their parts.

\subsection{Expanding classical mereology}
\label{expand}
Since not everything that has parts seems to be a mereological sum,
and since mereological sums cannot change their parts, there is some
motivation to amend standard mereology to account for these
divergences.

I will look at three different theories that attempt to provide a more
satisfactory mereology.  Section \ref{fine-h} will discuss Kit Fine's
theory of `embodiments'.  Section \ref{hovda} will discuss Paul
Hovda's tensed theory.  Section \ref{fine-c} will discuss Fine's more
recent theory of composition operators.  What is common to these three
theories (and, I suspect, any adequate modification of standard
mereology) is that they entail the existence of a plurality of
completely overlapping (co-located) objects; in particular, completely
overlapping {\em thinkers}.  If this consequence is unacceptable, we
will have to reject all three theories.

\section{First theory: rigid and variable embodiments}
\label{fine-h}
An outline of Kit Fine's `hylomorphic' theory is presented in his
paper ``Things and their parts'' \citeyearpar{fine1999}.  His
objective in that paper is not to present a framework for talking
about things like groups and teams, although what he says can be put
to such a purpose.  Rather, his objective is to present a satisfactory
account of how things persist (or don't persist) over time.

In section \ref{change} I explained why I am assuming that
mereological sums do not change their parts.  Moreover, I am assuming
that mereological composition is {\em unrestricted}---for any
(material) things, there is another thing composed of them (this is
the assumption of universalism that I attempted to motivate in section
\ref{universe}).

Given these assumptions, a mereological sum exists whenever the things
that compose it exist.  The mereological sum of $a, b, c$ exists
whenever (and wherever) $a, b, c$ exist.

Now, however, there are some composite objects that do not seem to
obey these assumptions.  Take a ham sandwich, for example.  It has two
slices of bread and a piece of ham as parts.  It seems to fit the
definition of a mereological sum.  But

\begin{squote}
the sum $a + b + c + \mathellipsis $ will exist {\em whenever} any of
its components $a, b, c, \mathellipsis $ exists (just as it is
located, at any time, {\em wherever} any of its components are
located).  It follows that, under the proposed analysis of the ham
sandwich, it will exist as soon as the piece of ham or either slice of
bread exists.  Yet surely this is not so.  Surely the ham sandwich
will not exist until the ham is actually placed between the two slices
of bread.  After all, one {\em makes} a ham sandwich; and to make
something is to bring into existence something that formerly did not
exist \citep[62]{fine1999}.
\end{squote}

If it is true that the sandwich comes into existence only when the
bread and meat are put together, then the sandwich cannot be a
mereological sum in the classical sense.  How, then, is it composed?

\subsection{Composition relations}
\label{rigid}
Fine's suggestion is that things like the sandwich be seen not merely
as the sum of the bread and meat, but as an object composed of the
bread and the meat {\em standing in the relation of `betweenness'}.
Likewise, a bunch of flowers is not merely the sum of the individual
flowers, but as an object composed of the flowers {\em in the relation
  of being bunched}:

\begin{squote}
Given objects $a, b, c, \mathellipsis $ and given a relation $R$ that
may hold or fail to hold of those objects at any given time, we
suppose that there is a new object---what one may call ``the objects
$a, b, c, \mathellipsis $ in the relation $R$.''  So, for example,
given some flowers and given the relation of being bunched, there will
be a new object---the flowers in the relation of being bunched (what
might ordinarily be called a ``bunch of flowers'')
\citeyearpar[65]{fine1999}.
\end{squote}

The addition of a relation or property that holds of the objects
allows us to distinguish co-located objects like the statue and the
lump of clay.  The statue might be composed of the clay when
possessing the property of being a statue (or just a work of art).
The property of being a statue would be understood to {\em not} apply
to squashed lumps of clay.  This would be a {\em character postulate}
of a statue:

\begin{squote}
The character postulates state what descriptive properties a [thing]
will have---whether, for example, it is red or heavy or much admired.
What these postulates are will depend upon the properties and the sort
of [thing] in question \citep[67]{fine1999}.
\end{squote}

We can apply this theory to groups like the Supreme Court.  The
Supreme Court is a thing composed of people (justices) who stand in
the relation of being jointly endowed with the power of interpreting
the Constitution.  We can specify the character postulates for the
Supreme Court however we like.  Whether the Supreme Court is located
wherever the justices are, whether the weight of the Supreme Court is
equal to the combined weight of the justices or if, strictly speaking,
it weighs nothing at all---the answers to these questions are more or
less up to us.

\subsection{How things change their parts}
\label{h-part}
This proposal by Fine---to think of objects as having parts that stand
in a certain relation---does not allow for things to change their
parts over time.  Fine stipulates that a thing $x$ composed of $a, b,
c$ in relation $R$ exists at a time $t$ if and only if $R$ holds of
$a, b, c$ at $t$.  If $x$ exists at $t_1$, it is because $a, b, c$ are
in $R$ at that time.  If at $t_2$, $a, b, c$ are not in $R$---say that
only $b, c$ are in that relation---then $x$ does not exist.

I am not sure, but I assume that Fine introduces this stipulation
because he is a universalist and believes that composition is
unrestricted.  If composition is unrestricted, then for any things
($z$s) in a relation $R$, there is an object composed of the $z$s in
that relation.  Suppose, as above, that there is an object $x$
composed of $a, b, c$ in relation $R$.  If $a, b$ alone also stand in
$R$, then, {\em if} composition is unrestricted, there is also an
object $y$ composed of $a, b$ in relation $R$.  Objects $x$ and $y$
have different parts and are therefore different things.

Now suppose $c$ is destroyed or somehow no longer stands in $R$ with
$a, b$.  We cannot say that $x$ has lost a part and is now composed of
$a, b$ in $R$.  There is already an object composed of $a, b$ in
$R$---the object $y$.  If we said that $x$ has lost a part, we would
be committed to the claim that $x = y$, even though previously $x \neq
y$.  If $y$ exists, then we must say that $x$ ceases to exist when it
loses a part ($c$).  Fine calls things like these---things that cannot
change their parts---{\em rigid embodiments}.

Therefore Fine has a separate proposal for objects that can change
their parts.  These things Fine calls {\em variable embodiments}.
Variable embodiments have, at different times, different {\em rigid}
embodiments as parts.  What part a variable embodiment has at a given
time is determined by a function that assigns rigid embodiments to
times.  Fine illustrates this with the water of a river:

\begin{squote}
I take it that the water in the river in the second sense---what we may
call the variable water---is now constituted by one quantity of water
and now by another. But what is the variable water?\,\ldots

I would like to take the bold step of supposing that there is here a
hitherto unrecognized method by which wholes may be formed from parts.
In the case of the variable water, there is a function, or
``principle,'' that determines which quantity of water constitutes the
variable water at any given time \citeyearpar[68]{fine1999}.
\end{squote}

In effect, {\em the water} of the river---the thing that is the
variable embodiment---is composed of other things---rigid embodiments
that are in turn composed of water molecules.  The water molecules are
not `directly' part of {\em the water}, but they are parts of its
parts.

\subsection{Problems with the first theory}
\label{problems1}
There are two problems with this theory.  First, it has the
consequence that relations (like `being bunched') are actually {\em
  parts} of things (the relation of being bunched is part of the bunch
of flowers).  Second, it produces a plurality of co-located objects.

It is certainly not true that a relation is part of a bunch of flowers
in the same way that the flowers are part of the bunch.  Fine
recognizes this; it constitutes one of his objections to a possible
extension of standard mereology.  He observes that one could claim
that mereological sums are made up of things like bread and meat as
well as {\em tropes}, or relations.  But

\begin{squote}
even if we grant that the trope is a part of the sandwich, it is hard
to believe that it is a part in the same way as the standard
ingredients.  Thus we should not regard the sandwich as a
straightforward mereological sum of $s_1$, $s_2$, $h$, and $r$, but in
some other way that has yet to be made clear \citep[64]{fine1999}.
\end{squote}

Fine's theory of embodiments recognizes relations as parts of things,
but in a different way than things like slices of bread are parts of
things.  This is suggested by his notation for a rigid embodiment of
$a$, $b$, and $c$ in relation $R$: $a, b, c / R$.  But this does not
explain in {\em what} way relations are parts of things.  Moreover, it
just seems false that the relation of being bunched {\em is} a part of
the bunch of flowers in any way.  The relation {\em holds} of the
flowers, and it explains why the flowers are a bunch, but that does
not convince me that the relation is in fact part of the bunch.  In
section \ref{all-sum} we saw examples of many different kinds of
things that have many different kinds of parts.  Tennis matches have
sets, sets have members, poems have stanzas, stanzas have lines, lines
have words.  But {\em relations} were not included in this catalog of
parts.  A theory that has the consequence that relations are parts is,
at least, unintuitive.  (Fine's theory can be modified to avoid this
consequence, as we will see in section \ref{fine-c}.)

The second problem with Fine's theory is one that will plague all
three theories: it posits a plurality of co-located objects.  Suppose
$a$, $b$, and $c$ are pieces of clay that have been formed into a
statue.  There is an object $S = ( a, b, c / R )$, where $R$ is the
relation of being formed into a statue.  $S$ is a statue.  But there
is also an object $L = ( a, b, c / R^{\prime} ) $, where $R^{\prime}$
is the relation of being lumped together.  $L$ is a lump of clay.  If
the statue is squashed, $R^{\prime}$ (the relation of begin lumped)
still holds of $a$, $b$, and $c$, but $R$ (the relation of being
formed into a statue) does not.  $R$ and $R^{\prime}$ therefore have
different {\em persistence conditions} with regard to $a$, $b$, and
$c$.

For every relation $R^{\prime \prime}$ that has different persistence
conditions with regard to $a$, $b$, and $c$, there is an object
composed of $a$, $b$, and $c$ in the relation $R^{\prime \prime}$.
Fine illustrates how this might occur with people as well as lumps:

\begin{squote}
An especially important class of cases are those in which the
principle of embodiment is a property $P$ rather than a polyadic
relation $R$.  The rigid embodiment is then of the form ``$a/P$'' and
may be read as ``$a$ qua $P$'' or as ``$a$ under the description
$P$.''  An airline passenger, for example, is not the same as the
person who is the passenger since, in counting the passengers who pass
through an airport on a given weekend, we may legitimately count the
same person several times.  This therefore suggests that we should
take an airline passenger to be someone under the description of being
flown on such and such a flight.  And similarly for mayors and judges
and other ``personages'' of this sort \citeyearpar[67--68]{fine1999}.
\end{squote}

I find this to be an unacceptable consequence of Fine's theory.
Persons can think, and airline passengers can think as well.  We are
therefore being asked to accept that there are at least {\em two}
thinking things in every seat on the airplane.  (And there will almost
certainly be more than two: some of the passengers may be mayors
and/or judges.)

Unfortunately, this `explosion of reality' is not limited to our first
theory.  The second theory, as we will see, results in a similar
explosion.

\section{Second theory: tensed mereology}
\label{hovda}
Paul Hovda has proposed an amended version of classical mereology that
presupposes neither eternalism nor presentism, and that allows for
mereological sums to change their parts over time.  (In his paper
``Tensed mereology'' \citeyearpar{hovda2011} he in fact offers three
versions of his theory; I will focus on the first formulation.)

{\em Tensed mereology} is similar to Fine's theory of embodiments in
at least one important way.  According to both theories, some relation
or property is required to specify when and where a sum of some things
exist.  Fine's example was of a bunch of flowers; the flowers compose
the bunch when and only when the relation of being bunched holds of
them.

Hovda uses the term `condition' to cover both relations and
properties:

\begin{squote}
We will want a ``condition'' to be an open sentence that may have more
than one free variable, \emph{together with a specification of a
  target variable}. For example, we will want to consider
``conditions'' like ``$y$ loves $x$'', with ``$x$'' as target.  This
is because we want to consider, in effect, for each object that might
be a value of the variable ``$y$'', the property of being a thing
loved by that object.  The point of this may be brought out by an
example.  We want as an instance of the plenitude principle, roughly
this: that for every $y$, if $y$ loves at least one thing, then there
is a thing $b$ such that $b$ is a fusion of the condition (with
respect to $x$) ``$y$ loves $x$'' (i.e., a fusion of the condition of
being loved by $y$) \citeyearpar[??n2]{hovda2011}.
\end{squote}

With this notion in mind, Hovda provides two kinds of fusions (sums) to
replace classical mereological fusions (sums):

\begin{description}
  \item[Synchronic fusion] An object $b$ is a ``synchronic fusion'' of
    a condition iff: both (1) every $x$ that meets the condition is
    part of $b$; and (2) every part of $b$ overlaps something that
    meets the condition.
  \item[Diachronic fusion] An object $b$ is a ``diachronic fusion'' of
    a condition iff: it is always the case that $b$ synchronically
    fuses the condition \citeyearpar[??]{hovda2011}.
\end{description}

Like Fine, Hovda takes composition to be unrestricted: ``the key
existential idea is roughly that \emph{for any condition, it has a
  fusion}'' \citeyearpar[??]{hovda2011}.

Fine's theory of embodiments included a postulate that the relation or
propertie that holds of the other parts of a thing is itself a part of
thing.  The sums produced by synchronic and diachronic fusions, on the
other hand, do not have the condition as a part.  This is an advantage
of the theory of tensed mereology.  However, because a condition is
not a part of the thing it fuses, how are we to distinguish between
co-located things?  

Co-located things cannot be distinguished {\em extensionally}---they
cannot be distinguished by the objects that meet the condition that
was fused to produce them.  When Tibbles the cat is standing up, the
synchronic fusion of the condition of being Tibbles and synchronic
fusion of the condition of being Tibbles standing up will be
co-located because, at that time, the two conditions are
co-extensional---they apply to the same things.

%%%%%%

Co-located things must therefore be distinguished {\em intensionally}.
The condition of being Tibbles the cat and the condition of being
Tibbles standing up are clearly different conditions.  Let us call the
first Condition A and the second Condition B; Condition A $\neq$
Condition B.  Therefore, the property of `being a fusion of Condition
A' is a different property than `being the fusion of Condition B'.
The object that is the fusion of Condition A has the property `being a
fusion of Condition A'; it does not have the property `being a fusion
of Condition B'.  The object that is the fusion of Condition B has the
property `being a fusion of Condition B'; it does not have the
property `being a fusion of Condition A'.  Therefore the co-located
objects each have a property the other lacks; therefore they are not
identical.

% What about objects (diachronic fusions) that are co-located for the
% entirety of their existence?\,\ldots

%% A discouraging analogy might be drawn with classical mereology.  The
%% definitions of mereology that I quoted in section \ref{tech} used
%% plural quantifiers like ``the $x$s''.  But they are often formulated
%% using sets instead.  For example, instead of saying ``$y$ is composed
%% of the $x$s'', we can say ``$y$ fuses $S$'', where $S$ is a set whose
%% members are all and only the $x$s.  When classical mereology is given
%% this set-theoretic formulation, it is assumed that for every set,
%% there is one and only one thing that fuses that set.

\subsection{Problems with the second theory}
\label{problems2}
Hovda's tensed mereology avoids the conclusion that conditions or
relations are parts of things, but like Fine's theory of embodiments,
it produces a huge number of things.  And like Fine's theory, it
produces a huge number of co-located objects; some of them being
co-located {\em thinkers}.

The example of Tibbles above (one of Hovda's) is one example of
co-located thinkers.  (If you think that cats cannot think, substitute
Socrates for the cat.)  The object that fuses the condition of being a
cat surely thinks.  How, then can the object that fuses the condition
of being a sitting cat {\em not} think?

There is a clear parallel with Fine's example of the airline
passenger.  The object that fuses the condition of being a person is
not the condition of being an airline passenger; the latter obtains
only when I board the plane.  But both thinks clearly think.  It
seems, therefore, that we are committed to its being the case that
when I board an airplane, {\em a co-located thinker comes into
  existence}.  If this is in fact a consequence of the theory of
tensed mereology, it should be cause for alarm.

\subsection{Onward}
\label{hovda-o}
The first two theories we have examined do not entail a great increase
in the number of {\em kinds} of things that there are.  Fine's theory
of embodiments proposed that relations are parts of sums, and Hovda's
theory proposed that there are two kinds of sums.  The third theory is
more expansive.  Kit Fine, in ``Toward a theory of part''
\citeyearpar{fine2010}, suggests that not only are there a plurality
of mereological sums, but that there is a plurality of {\em kinds of
  things}; sums are only one kind in a vast ``mereological
firmament''.  Fine's theory is extremely interesting, but ultimately
it faces the problem of co-location (in particular co-located
thinkers) that face the previous two theories.

\section{Third theory: composition operators}
\label{fine-c}
Fine has recently published a theory of parthood that has many
connections with his theory of {\em rigid embodiments} (see section
\ref{rigid}).  That theory, while including relations as parts of
things, did not specify that different things (like words, or sets)
had their parts in different ways.  But as we saw in section
\ref{all-sum}, this seems to be the case.  The way that letters are
parts of words is different from the way members are parts of sets,
and both are different from the way things are parts of sums.  Fine's
new theory begins with this `pluralist' claim about parthood.

\subsection{Problems for pluralists}
\label{sets}
There are, however, a number of objections to Fine's pluralism about
parthood.  The first objection is that while parthood is supposed to
be transitive, the membership relation of sets is not.  The letter `n'
is a member of the set \{`n',\{`n',`o'\}\}, but `o' is not.  The
objection claims that sets have {\em members}, not parts, and that
Fine has confused the two.

But while it is true that the membership relation is not the parthood
relation, this is no reason to think that sets do not have parts.  A
given set will have certain members---the $x$s---and certain
parts---the $y$s---and only sometimes will the $x$s and the $y$s be
the very same things.  The set \{`n',\{`n',`o'\}\} has two members
but three parts.  The parthood relation for sets can even be defined
in set-theoretic terms:

\begin{squote}
It may well be thought that the way in which a member is a part of a
set is given, not by the membership relation itself, but by the
ancestral of the membership relation, where this is the relation that
holds between $x$ and $y$ when $x$ is a member of $y$ or a member of a
member of $y$ or a member of a member of a member of $y$, and so on
\citep[563]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

A second objection is that talk of parthood in connection with things
like sets is somehow metaphorical or non-literal.  We saw above that
van Inwagen admits that many different things are said to have parts.
However, he qualifies this in two ways.  First, he seems to have
doubts (or at least is sympathetic with those who have doubts) as to
whether the non-material things that are said to have parts really
exist:

\begin{squote}
The word `part' is applied to things that are clearly \emph{not}
material objects---or at least it is on the assumption that these
things really exist and that apparent reference to them is not a mere
manner of speaking \citep[19]{inwagen1995}.
\end{squote}

If there are no such things as tennis matches or poems or papers, then
of course they do not have parts.  But I think it is obviously true
that there are such things.  This being so, what does it mean to say
that they have parts?  This is where van Inwagen's second
qualification comes in.  For he suggests not only that the `parts' of
tennis matches and poems are parts in a different way than are the
parts of a table, but that these different relations of parthood are
only tenuously connected.  Van Inwagen says that the various relations
of parthood (if such there be) are connected only by the ``unity of
analogy'' \citeyearpar[19]{inwagen1995}.  If the only similarity
between the parthood relation for poems and the parthood relation for
chairs is that they share the `analogy' of parthood, then is there
anything important or interesting about `parts' of poems?  Is the
parthood relation for sets likewise only interesting because of the
analogy with the parthood relation for chairs?

At least in the case of parthood for sets, the notion does not appear
to be wholly metaphorical:

\begin{squote}
In the case of set-membership, there would appear to be nothing that
might plausibly be taken to indicate that the talk of part-whole is
not to be taken literally. A set is indeed composed of or built up
from its members, and we should add that we may meaningfully
talk---and in the intended way---of \emph{replacing} one member of a
set with another.  Thus Aristotle in the set \{Plato, Aristotle\} may
be replaced with Socrates to obtain the set \{Plato, Socrates\}, with
the given set becoming a different set from what it was. In the case
of sets, our conception of members as parts seems to extend all the
way \citep[564]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

But the second worry raised by van Inwagen remains.  Why should we
think that there is any {\em real} similarity between these different
parthood relations, other than the fact that we call them all
`parthood'?

\subsection{Operationalism}
\label{operation}
Fine's theory of {\em operationalism} helps answer this worry.
Various {\em operations} produce different things---mereological
summation produces mereological sums or fusions, the set-builder
produces sets, and so forth.  Parts are therefore {\em things} that
have been `combined', through one or more such operations, into a
single {\em thing}.  What is common to all parthood relations is that
from each set of parts is produced a {\em whole} by means of a
composition operator.  From parts (letters, atoms) are made something
else (a word, a set, a chair).  What ties together all the ways of
being a part is that they are involved in a composition operation that
produces a single thing from a number of things:

\begin{squote}
In formulating the principles of mereology, it has been usual to take
the relation of part-whole or some associated relation (such as
overlap) as primitive.  But I believe that, in formulating a more
general theory, it is important to take the operation of composition
as primitive rather than the more familiar relation of part-whole.  In
the case of classical mereology, the operation of composition will
take some objects into the sum or fusion of those objects, while, in
the set-theoretic case, it will take some objects into the set of
those objects; and, in general, the operation of composition will be
the characteristic means (summation, set-builder, and so on) by which
a given kind of whole is formed from its parts \citep[565]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

Each way of being a part can then be defined in terms of the related
composition operation:

\begin{squote}
Once given a compositional operation, a corresponding relation of part
may be defined in two steps.  We say first that $x$ is a component of
$y$ if $y$ is the result of applying $\sum$ to $x$ or to $x$ and some
other objects.  In other words, $y$ should be of the form $\sum
(x_{1}, x_{2}, \mathellipsis )$, where at least one of $x_1$, $x_2,
\mathellipsis$ is $x$.  Thus when $\sum$ is mereological summation the
components of an object will be mere parts, and where $\sum$ is the
set-builder the components of an object will be its members.  We may
then define $x$ to be a part of $y$ if there is a sequence of objects
$x_1$, $x_2, \mathellipsis x_n$, $n$ \textgreater{} $0$, for which $x
= x_1$, $y = x_n$, and $x_i$ is a component of $x_{i+1}$ for $i = 1$,
$2, \mathellipsis, n-1$. The parts of an object are the object itself,
or its components, or the components of the components, and so on
\citep[567--568]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

The parthood relation for mereological sums can therefore be seen to
exhibit reflexivity, transitivity and anti-symmetry:

\begin{description}
\item[Reflexivity] Each object is a part of itself.
\item[Transitivity] If $x$ is a part of $y$ and $y$ of $z$, then $x$
  is a part of $z$.
\item[Anti-symmetry] $x$ is a part of $y$ and $y$ of $x$ only when $x
  = y$ \citep[568]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

But not all definitions of parthood that issue from a composition
operator will exhibit these features:

\begin{squote}
When the underlying operation is summation, each object will be a part
of itself, since the unit sum of any object is the object itself, but
when the underlying operation is the set-builder, no object will be a
part of itself, since no object is ever an ancestral member of itself
\citep[569]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

\subsection{Principles}
\label{principle}
Each composition operation will, according to Fine, be governed by
various principles:

\begin{squote}
I believe that the principles governing the basic forms of composition
will conform to a general template.  Variations in the principles for
the different forms of composition will then arise from variations in
how the template is to be filled in.  The template will comprise two
broad categories of principle---the {\em formal} and the {\em
  material} (though not quite in the sense of Husserl).  Among the
formal principles, we may distinguish between those that provide
conditions of application for the operation and those that provide
identity conditions; among the material principles, we may distinguish
between those that provide conditions for the presence of a whole (in
space and time or at a world) and those that specify the descriptive
character of the whole.  The presence conditions, in their turn, may
concern either the existence of the whole or its extension
\citeyearpar[569--570]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

\paragraph{Formal principles}
\label{formal}
The formal principles govern when composition occurs and when two
products of a composition operation are identical:

\begin{description}
  \item[Application] The application conditions are ``the conditions
    under which there are wholes of a given sort---which, on the
    operational approach, is a matter of stating when the result of
    applying the compositional operation to various objects will be
    defined'' \citep[570]{fine2010}.  For the summation operation, the
    application conditions are very lax: for any $n$ physical objects
    (where $n$ \textgreater{} 1), there is a thing composed of those
    objects.  The application conditions for the set-builder will be
    more limited; and other operations will be more restricted
    still. \label{fine-app}
  \item[Identity] Setting out identity conditions on Fine's
    operational approach ``is a matter of stating when a whole formed
    in one way by means of the compositional operation is the same as
    a given object or a whole that has been formed in some other way''
    \citeyearpar[570]{fine2010}.  For example, suppose $y$ is the
    result of applying the summation operator to $x$, and suppose
    $y^\prime$ is the result of applying the set-builder to $x$.  If
    $y \neq y^\prime$, it will be because of some difference in the
    respective operations that produced these composites.  As we will
    see below, the summation operator is defined such that its
    application to a single thing ($x$) produces that very thing.  The
    set-builder, however, produces the singleton of $x$, which is not
    $x$.  And whereas applying the set-builder to nothing produces the
    null set, the result of applying the summation operator to nothing
    might be undefined---nothing would result.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Material principles}
\label{material}
As above, there are two subcategories:

\begin{description}
  \item[Presence] Fine claims that ``there are two fundamentally
    different ways in which an object might be present in space or
    time; it may \emph{exist} in space or time, or it may be
    \emph{extended} (or \emph{located}) in space or time. Thus a
    material thing will exist in time but be extended in space while
    an event will be extended in both space and time''
    \citeyearpar[570]{fine2010}.  Whether or not this is actually true
    seems to depend on whether a `three-dimensional' theory of
    persistence is correct.  However, that question will remain unasked.
  \item[Character] ``The character conditions will tend to have a much
    more ad hoc character than the other conditions that we have
    considered. The color of a house, for example, is the color of its
    siding; the color of an egg, the color of its shell; the color of
    a pencil, the color of its lead. In the case of the `intrinsic'
    character of a thing---such as its mass or color---the character
    of the whole will be some sort of function of the character of the
    parts. But the function in question will vary from case to case''
    \citep[571]{fine2010}.  What we decide is the color of a house
    will turn on our concept `house', rather than anything about the
    house itself (anything beyond its having that color to {\em some}
    extent).
\end{description}

\subsection{Fine's pluralist account of classical mereology}
\label{classical}
Of the principles sketched above, Fine gives most attention to the
identity conditions for composition operations.  The composition
operation used as a paradigm is the summation operation of classical
mereology.  Fine's exposition of identity conditions for sums relies
on the notion of `regularity':

\begin{squote}
Call an identity condition $s = t$ {\em regular} if the variables
appearing in $s$ and in $t$ are the same.  Thus $\sum (x, y) = \sum
(y, x)$ is regular while $\sum (x, y) = x$ is not
\citeyearpar[572]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

With this notion in hand, Fine proposes this condition for identity of
sums:

\begin{description}
  \item[Summative Identity] $s = t$ whenever `$s = t$' is a regular
    identity \citeyearpar[572]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

One particularly interesting aspect of this condition is that it
entails four more principles of the summation operation:

\begin{description}
  \item[Absorption] $\sum (\mathellipsis, x, x, \mathellipsis,
    \mathellipsis, y, y, \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis = \sum (
    \mathellipsis, x, \mathellipsis, y, \mathellipsis )$;
\item[Collapse] $\sum (x) = x$;
\item[Leveling] $\sum (\mathellipsis, \sum (x, y, z, \mathellipsis ),
  \mathellipsis, \sum (u, v, w, \mathellipsis ), \mathellipsis ) \\ =
  \sum (\mathellipsis, x, y, z, \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis, u, v, w,
  \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis )$;
\item[Permutation] $\sum (x, y, z, \mathellipsis ) = \sum (y, z, x,
  \mathellipsis )$ (and similarly for all other permutations)
  \citep[573]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

We can define other compositional identity criteria (e.g., sequences)
in terms of which of these principles apply to their compositional
operation.  But we may also devise new principles by which we may then
define new types of composition:

\begin{squote}
We should note that there would appear to be no good reason to require
that the defining principles for the various operations should be
limited to the particular principles (C [collapse], L [leveling], A
[absorption], and P [permutation]) that we used in characterizing
sums; for any set of regular identities would appear to be equally
well suited to defining a basic form of composition, so long as they
conform to Anti-cyclicity.  Indeed, I would conjecture that any such
set of principles in fact will correspond to a form of composition and
a corresponding form of whole.  How the resulting forms of composition
and whole might be organized is an interesting question, but it should
be apparent that the approach will lead to an infinitude of forms of
composition, each differing from one another in how exactly the
identity of the resulting wholes is to be
determined. \citep[575--576]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

It is at this point that the importance of Fine's theory becomes
obvious.  Above I stressed that things like teams and families are
really {\em things}; moreover I made this claim as part of an attempt
to motivate a sort of universalistic outlook on metaphysics.  I argued
that the term `composition' was potentially misleading, but that it
was nevertheless correct to say that things like dogbushes, wish
sandwiches, and teams are composed of their parts.  But now it is
apparent that `composition' will mean something different when applied
to each of these things.  Each thing will be the product of a
different composition operation.

Fine's theory reveals new {\em kinds} of universalism.  One might be
committed to the existence of dogbushes---and so to unrestricted
mereological composition---but deny the existence of teams, groups,
crews, and families.  Or one might defend unrestricted composition of
groups while claiming a restriction on mereological composition.

Below I will look at how a definition of the composition operator for
groups might be formulated.  But I will first return to Fine's theory.

\subsection{Hybrid parts}
\label{hybrid}
Above, we saw that one objection to the idea of sets having parts was
that parthood is transitive and set-membership is not.  Moreover it
was supposed (rather plausibly) that the only reason we think that
sets have parts is {\em because} they have members; it is the members
of a set that we are tempted to call parts.  But, the objection goes,
it is a mistake to think of members as part.  I am the only member of
my singleton (the singleton of $x$ is the set resulting from applying
the set-builder to $x$ alone).  My hand, for instance, is not a member
of my singleton.  But my hand is a part of me.  If I was a part of my
singleton, then---because parthood is transitive---my hand would be a
part of my singleton.  And if that means that my hand is a {\em
  member} of my singleton, that is clearly wrong.

Fine points out, of course, that the objection makes the mistake of
supposing that something (me, my hand) can be a part in only one way
(in this case, through set-membership).  Once we recognize that there
are a plurality of ways of being a part, it becomes clear that my hand
is part of the set in one way, but not in another:

\begin{squote}
Given the specific relations of part, we may derive various {\em
  hybrid} relations of part.  Suppose, for example, that we are given
the relations of set-theoretic and mereological part---which we may
designate as \textepsilon -part and $m$-part. We may then take one
object to be an \textepsilon ,$m$-part of another if it is an
\textepsilon -part or an $m$-part or an $m$-part of an \textepsilon
-part or an \textepsilon -part of an $m$-part, or an $m$-part of an
\textepsilon -part of an $m$-part, and so on. More generally, if $K$
is a family of specific ways of being a part, we may take an object to
be a {\em K-part} of another if $x$ and $y$ can be linked by
relationships of $k$-part for $k$ in $K$ \citep[579]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

My hand is a \textepsilon ,$m$-part of my singleton, but not a
\textepsilon -part.

By conjoining every way of being a part, we arrive at the most general
notion of part:

\begin{squote}
Among the hybrid relations of part, of special interest is the
relation of $K$-part where $K$ is the family of {\em all} the specific
ways of being a part.  This is the relation of $K$-part that holds
between two objects when they may be linked by relationships of
$k$-part without restriction on $k$.  We might call it the {\em
  general} relation of part, and it is a relation that holds between
$x$ and $y$ whenever $x$ is in any way whatever a part of $y$
\citep[580]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

\subsection{Generating kinds}
\label{generate}
On this theory, what kind a thing is depends on what operation
produced it.  If a chair or a dogbush is a mereological sum, then this
is because they are produced by the summation operation.  The Dunn
family is `produced' by the family operation.  Groups are produced by
the group operation (see section \ref{group}).

But there is a difficulty to be avoided here.  As we saw in section
\ref{classical}, the mereological sum of a single thing $x$ is just
$x$.  Therefore there is a sense in which every physical thing,
including every simple, is a mereological sum, for the application of
the summation operation would just produce that thing.  To avoid this
consequence Fine introduces the notion of a {\em generative}
application of an operation:

\begin{squote}
We might say that the application $y = \Gamma (x_1, x_2, x_3,
\mathellipsis )$ of an operation $\Gamma$ is {\em generative} if there
is an explanation of the identity of $y$ as $\Gamma (x_1, x_2, x_3,
\mathellipsis )$; and we might say that the operation $\Gamma$ is
itself {\em generative} if it permits a generative application. Thus
both the set-builder and the operation of predication will be
generative in this sense \citeyearpar[582]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

Whether or not the summation operation is generative depends on the
things it is being applied to.  When summing a dog and a tree, it is
generative; when summing a dog by itself, it is not.

For any operation, there will be things it applies to that it cannot
produce.  The summation operator fuses simples, but cannot produce
them; the set-builder combines many things that it cannot produce
(like letters).  For any given operation, there is a `level 0'
consisting of the things that the operator itself cannot produce:

\begin{squote}
We suppose that certain objects are simply given.  These are the
objects whose identity does not require an explanation in terms of
$\Gamma$.  Thus, when $\Gamma$ is the set-builder, they are the
objects that are not sets and, when $\Gamma$ is summation, they are
the objects that are not sums or, rather, the objects that do not need
to be seen as sums.

We now `generate' objects in stages.  At stage 0 are the givens; at
stage 1, we add the objects that result from a single application of
the generative operation $\Gamma$ to the givens \citep[583]{fine2010}.
\end{squote}

An application can now be identified as generative in a strong or a
weak sense:

\begin{description}
  \item[Strong generative application] Also called `strict' by Fine, a
    ``[strong] generative application of $\Gamma$ to the objects $x_1,
    x_2, \mathellipsis$ can now be defined as one in which $y = \Gamma
    (x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis )$ is of a higher level than each of
    $x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis$'' \citeyearpar[584]{fine2010}.  For
    example, summing the simples $x$ and $y$ to produce the fusion $z$
    would be a strong generative application of the summation
    operator; the simples are level 0 and $z$ is level 1.  Summing two
    composites, or a composite and a simple, would not be strongly
    generative; one or both of the parts would be the same level (1)
    as the product.
  \item[Weak generative application] To illuminate this notion Fine
    introduces another, that of a {\em putative generative
      application}: ``Let us say, in the first place, that $y = \Gamma
    (x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis )$ is a putative generative application
    of $\Gamma$ if $y$ is of a higher or of the same level as each of
    $x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis$.  This gives us the notions of a
    putative prior component and of a putative prior in the usual way.
    We now say that the application $y = \Gamma (x_1, x_2,
    \mathellipsis )$ of $\Gamma$ is a {\em weak} generative
    application if it is the putative generative application and if
    $y$ is not putatively prior to any of $x1, x2, \mathellipsis$.  We
    can get from $x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis$ to $y$ without an ascent in
    level but not from $y$ to any of $x_1, x_2, \mathellipsis$''
    \citeyearpar[584]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

Applying the summation operator to a simple is neither strongly nor
weakly generative.  It is not strongly generative because the result
is a simple, which is at level 0---the same level as its part
(itself).  It is not weakly generative because the result of the
operation is putatively prior to its parts.

\section{Groups and sets}
\label{group}
Fine's theory gives us the resources to define new composition
operators, and so new {\em kinds} of things.  But there is no point in
defining a composition operator for a kind of thing that does not
appear in the world.  For example, suppose that unicorns are a special
kind of thing.  We could, presumably, define their existence
conditions and define a `unicorn-builder'---a composition operator for
unicorns.  But there are no unicorns, so why should we.  If we are to
define a kind of thing, we should first determine that there are such
things.  One kind of thing that does seem to have instances, unlike
{\em unicorn}, is {\em group}.

Why should we think that there are groups, in addition to sets?  One
important reason is the apparent fact that groups can change their
parts, while sets cannot.  If groups are distinct from sets, we should
be able to define a group-builder that is distinct from a set-builder.
However, one new composition operator---the `group-builder'---will not
be enough.  We will see that, if we wish to introduce groups, we will
have to introduce many {\em kinds} of groups.  Fine's theory of parts
allows us to do this, but it is not clear that we ought to.  For it
may be that every group will be itself a {\em unique} kind of thing.

If we wish to avoid this conclusion, we may have to reject parts of
Fine's theory and place a limit on the kinds of things there are.  But
there are costs on both approaches.

\subsection{Motivating groups}
\label{why-group}
The set-builder, on Fine's theory, takes things (such as jurists) and
produces a set composed of them.  There is a set $S$ composed of the
2004 Supreme Court justices:

\begin{squote}
$S = \sum _{\in}$ (Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy,
  Souter, Thomas, \\ Ginsburg, Breyer) $ = $ \{Rehnquist, Stevens,
  O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, \\ Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer\}
\end{squote}

But some claim that, in addition to sets, there are also {\em groups}.
There may, in addition to the set \{Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor,
Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer\}, a group
containing the very same people.

One might ask why this is necessary.  Groups, it might be objected,
are really no different than sets.  When we speak of a group of
people, we are actually referring to the set of which they are
members.

But there are some reasons why it seems incorrect to identify groups
with sets.  Take the Supreme Court.  It seems that any attempt to
identify the Supreme Court with the set of the Supreme Court justices
will not succeed.  This is because the membership of the Supreme Court
changes over time, while the members of a set do not.  The set
containing the 1990 justices is a {\em different} set from the set
containing the 2012 justices, but the 2012 Supreme Court is not a
different entity than the 1990 Court.  (We may of course say things
like ``it's a different court now'', but by that we mean only that it
is composed of different people, and so may rule differently---note
that we do {\em not} say ``it's a different Court now''.)

If one grants that groups such as the Supreme Court are not sets, it
may be objected that they are therefore simply mereological sums.  But

\begin{squote}
membership in the Supreme Court is very different from
the part-whole relation on material objects.  The part-whole relation
on material objects is a transitive relation.  Thus if one identified
the Supreme Court with a material object and Justice Breyer with a
part of it, then one would be forced to conclude that Justice Breyer's
arm must be a part of the Supreme Court as well.  Yet, it is plain
that Justice Breyer's arm is neither a part nor a member of the
Supreme Court \citep[136--137]{uzquiano2004a}.
\end{squote}

If the Supreme Court were a mereological sum, it would behave very
strangely.  What its parts would be on a given occasion would depend
on the appointment decisions of the President.  (If we accept a
`four-dimensional' version of universalism, then objects have {\em
  temporal} as well as spatial parts.  There would then be a
mereological sum of the parts of the justices that existed during
their appointments.  This would be an object whose existence would not
depend on the President.)

There is at least some motivation to posit a new {\em kind} of thing
that is not a set or a sum.  This new kind is the group.
Unfortunately, once we try to spell out the identity conditions of
groups, we will see that groups are not one kind of thing: there are
many different kinds of things (possibly an infinite number of kinds
of things) that we lump under the term `group'.  

%% If we are to maintain that there are groups (that are not sets), we
%% will be committed to there being a plurality of kinds of things,
%% united under a family resemblance.

\subsection{The place of the group in Fine's template}
\label{group-temp}
In section \ref{classical} above, Kit Fine showed how the summation
operator relates to four different properties: Collapse, Leveling,
Absorption, and Permutation.

\begin{description}
  \item[Absorption] $\sum (\mathellipsis, x, x, \mathellipsis,
    \mathellipsis, y, y, \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis = \sum (
    \mathellipsis, x, \mathellipsis, y, \mathellipsis )$;
\item[Collapse] $\sum (x) = x$;
\item[Leveling] $\sum (\mathellipsis, \sum (x, y, z, \mathellipsis ),
  \mathellipsis, \sum (u, v, w, \mathellipsis ), \mathellipsis ) \\ =
  \sum (\mathellipsis, x, y, z, \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis, u, v, w,
  \mathellipsis, \mathellipsis )$;
\item[Permutation] $\sum (x, y, z, \mathellipsis ) = \sum (y, z, x,
  \mathellipsis )$ \citep[573]{fine2010}.
\end{description}

Sums have all four properties, while sets have only Permutation and
Absorption.  We can begin to define our group operator by thinking
about which of these properties it has.

I tentatively suggest that groups mimic sets with regard to these
four properties.  Groups possess Absorption due to the fact that one
cannot be twice a member of the same group.  Groups possess
Permutation, since there is no `order' with regard to membership of a
group (there may be {\em temporal} order---I joined the group
first!---but that is not the same thing).  Groups do not possess
Collapse, since (I am inclined to think) a group can have a single
member without thereby {\em being} that member.  If, for example, a
task force is created and only one individual assigned to it, the
findings of the task force will be of the {\em task force} and not of
the individual.  Groups do not possess Leveling either, since there
can be groups made up of groups.

%% So far we have seen that groups are quite similar to sets.  But there
%% are some differences.  As we have seen, groups can change their
%% membership, while sets cannot.  Additionally, I suggest that the
%% application conditions (see section \ref{fine-app}) for groups is
%% different from that of sets.  While sets can have more or less
%% anything as members (letters, people, other sets), I propose that {\em
%%   groups may be composed only of living things and other groups}.

%% This claim is made on intuitive grounds.  It simply seems odd to talk
%% about a group of rocks, or a group of sets.  Talk of groups implies
%% some sort of activity, and so it is more natural to use `group' to
%% refer to people and other animals.  Even a `group' of trees is not
%% wholly bizarre.  And a group---for example, the Special Committee on
%% Judicial Ethics---might be part of another group---the Committee of
%% Ethics Committees \citep[145]{uzquiano2004a}.

%% Another point on application conditions: I think that group
%% composition is {\em unrestricted} among living things and groups.
%% That is, for any set of living things and/or groups, there is a
%% group of them.  Any restriction seems arbitrary.

\subsection{How do groups change their members?}
\label{group-time}
The most important apparent difference between sets and groups is that
while the members of a set are necessarily so, the members of a group
may change over time.  How does this work?

We could think of the group composition operator (the group-builder)
as operating {\em not} on things (living things and groups) but on
things-at-times.  The group-builder for the Supreme Court takes the
various justices during the times of their service and produces the
group---the Supreme Court---from those people-at-times.

One problem with this proposal is that it appears to presuppose {\em
  temporal parts}.  For if the group-builder works in similar fashion
to the set-builder and summation operator, then it operates on {\em
  things}.  If our group-builder is going to operate on
people-at-times, then we seem to commit ourselves to the claim that
people-at-times are {\em things}.  And what things could they be but
temporal parts of other things?

Thinking of groups as being composed of things-at-times rather than
things is unintuitive in any case.  Sandra Day O'Connor \emph{was} a
member of the Supreme Court.  Taking temporal parts seriously would
require us saying instead that her 1981--2006 part \emph{is} a member
of the Supreme Court.  But Sandra Day O'Connor is no longer a member
{\em at all}.

If we don't want to presuppose temporal parts, the group operator has
to be somehow \emph{dynamic}. It can't just take things, compose them
and be done---it has to \emph{add and remove things over time}.

Making sense of a dynamic group operator might allow us to avoid
presupposing {\em eternalism} as well (ultimately it will not).  If
the group-builder made the Supreme Court `in one go', then future
justices would have to already exist in some sense.  How else could
the group-builder operate on them?

The most readily apparent way of making sense of a dynamic operator is
by relativizing the group-builder to times.  We can think of the
operator as taking a set at a time and producing a group: $G = \sum
_{t} (S)$.  (There are two interpretations of $\sum _{t}$: we might
say that the composition operator as (re-)producing a group at a
number of different times $t$, or we might say that there is a {\em
  different} composition operator at each time $t$.  I am not sure how
much depends on a choice here, but I will suppose that the former is
correct.)

Following \citet{uzquiano2004a}, we can say that set $S$
composes group $G$ at time $t$ if and only if:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
  \item $\forall x\ (x \in S \leftrightarrow x\ \text{is a member of}\ G
  \  @\ t)$
  \item $\exists x {[} x\ \text{is a member
      of}\ G\ @\ t\ \wedge\ \square ( x \in S )\ \wedge
    \\ \diamond\ \exists t^{\prime} ( G\ \text{exists}\ @
    \ t^{\prime}\ \wedge\ \neg ( x\ \text{is a member
      of}\ G\ @\ t^{\prime} )) {]}\ \vee \\ \exists x^{\prime} {[}
    \neg ( x^{\prime}\ \text{is a member of}\ G\ @\ t)\ \wedge \\ \neg
    \diamond (x^{\prime} \in S ) \wedge \ \diamond \exists t^{\prime
      \prime} (x^{\prime} \text{is a member of}\ G\ @\ t^{\prime
      \prime}) {]}$\ \citeyearpar[150]{uzquiano2004a}
\end{enumerate}

I will assume that group composition is {\em unrestricted}.  That is,
for any people and/or groups at any time $t$, there is a group
composed of them at that time.

\subsection{Identity conditions}
\label{group-id}
Given that groups can change their parts over time, there will be
cases in which $G = \sum _{t_1} ( S )$ and $G^{\prime} = \sum _{t_2}
( S^{\prime} )$ and $G = G^{\prime}$ and $t_1 \neq t_2$ and $S \neq
S^{\prime}$.  When will this occur?  Under what conditions does $G =
G^{\prime}$?

For example, $t_1$ might be 2004, $t_2$ might be 2012, $S$ might be
\{Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas,
Ginsburg, Breyer\} and $S^{\prime}$ might be \{Roberts, Stevens,
O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer\}.  If we
suppose that $G$ is the Supreme Court in 2004 and that $G^{\prime}$
is the Supreme Court, then we want to be able to say that $G =
G^{\prime}$.  

It may appear that we have hit a snag, however, For as Uzquiano points
out, a set of people can compose more than one group at a time.
Suppose that all and only the members of the Supreme Court in 2004 are
part of the Special Committee on Judicial Ethics.  In this case ``the
Supreme Court share[s] all of its members with the Special Committee
on Judicial Ethics as of a certain time [2004]''
\citep[151]{uzquiano2004a}.  It seems false to say that, in 2004, the
Supreme Court was identical with the Special Committee.  But if the
Supreme Court, $G$, is $\sum _{t} ( S )$ and the Special Committee,
$C$, is also $\sum _{t} ( S )$, then how can we deny that $G = C$?

%% One way is to allow that the group-builder can produce numerically
%% distinct groups from repeated applications of the same operation.

One proposal would be to look at the past and future histories of $G$
and $C$.  The Supreme Court is composed of $S^{\prime}$ in 2012, while
the Special Committee has been dissolved.  But I do not see how we can
appeal to identity across time without assuming eternalism.  If we
assume eternalism, we can say that $G = \sum ( \mathellipsis , \sum
_{2004}(S), \sum _{2012}(S^{\prime}), \mathellipsis )$.  But if we do
not assume eternalism, we will have to use temporal operators like
\textsc{was} and \textsc{will}.  We can therefore say only that
\textsc{was}($G = \sum (S)$), $G = \sum (S^{\prime})$ and
\textsc{will}($G = \sum (S^{\prime \prime})$).  We are still left with
its being presently the case that $G = C$.

What we {\em can} do is look at {\em possible} past and future
histories.  That is, we can appeal to the modal properties of the two
groups.  Recall Fine's discussion of the {\em character} conditions of
composition operators (section \ref{material}).  The characteristics,
or properties, of a thing will vary depending on the composition
operator used to produce it.  These properties may include modal
properties.  Different composition operators will produce things with
different modal properties.  Whatever members a set has, it has
necessarily; but a group may possibly have different members.  This is
because groups and sets are produced by means of different operators.

If we want the Supreme Court and the Special Committee to be distinct,
then we can assign them different modal properties.  But there is no
reason to restrict ourselves to modal properties.  The Supreme Court
and the Special Committee differ in many ways: the Supreme Court has
the power to interpret the Constitution, while the Special Committee
can issue reports on judicial ethics.  These different properties
correspond to differences in the character conditions of the two
groups.

But in order to have different character conditions, the Supreme Court
and the Special Committee must be produced by means of different
operators.  The Supreme Court will be the product of some operator
$\sum _{sc}$ and the Special Committee of $\sum _{sp}$.  And since
these two things are the products of different operators, they need
not be identical.

But just as sets and sums are different kinds of things, so the
Supreme Court and the Special Committee must now be recognized as not
merely different groups, but as different {\em kinds}.  There may be a
greater resemblance between their two kinds than there is between
things like sums and sets, but ultimately they have been estranged.
Calling both `groups' is simply categorizing both kinds under a common
label.

\subsection{A problem for the third theory}
\label{problem3}
Is there anything wrong with this conclusion?  It does seem bizarre in
some ways.  For it is clear enough that one person (or group) may be a
member of an infinite number of groups; each of these `groups' will
therefore be a product of a different composition operator.  And each
will, strictly speaking, be a different kind of thing.

Previously we had a relatively tidy ontology.  There were sums, and
sets, and other well-known kinds; but now each task force or
subcommittee is potentially a kind unto itself.  Fine recognizes that
his approach ``will lead to an infinitude of forms of
composition\,\ldots a vast mereological firmament''
\citeyearpar[576]{fine2010}.  But he does not consider this to be a
drawback.

Perhaps my resistance is unwarranted, but I want to maintain that the
Supreme Court, the Special Committee, and everything else we call a
group is of one kind.  This cannot be maintained in Fine's
mereological firmament.  So in section \ref{set-id} I will re-examine
the thesis that groups---all of them---really are identical with sets.
This will lead to some strange consequences, but it may be that they
are {\em less} strange than the `explosion of reality' that we
otherwise face.

\section{What if we assume four-dimensionalism?}
\label{4d}
So far I have been supposing that {\em four-dimensionalism} is false.
I have assumed neither that things are composed of temporal as well as
spatial parts, nor that the past and future exist.  But if we {\em do}
assume four-dimensionalism, we have access to new solutions to the
problems relating to ordinary things.

What is four-dimensionalism?  I am supposing that
`four-dimensionalism' refers to the conjunction of two theories.  The
first is that things have {\em temporal parts}.  The second is {\em
  eternalism}.  

Ted Sider presents a relatively clear picture of the first part of the
theory of four-dimensionalism, that of temporal parts:

\begin{squote}
Think of your life as a long story.  Let the story be a rather
narcissistic story: cut out all details about everything else except
you.  So the story begins with an infant (or perhaps a fetus).  It
describes the infant developing into a child and then an adolescent.
The adolescent passes into young adulthood, then adulthood, middle
age, and finally old age and death.  Like all stories, this story has
parts.  We can distinguish the part of the story concerning childhood
from the part concerning adulthood.  Given enough details, there will
be parts concerning individual days, minutes, or even instants.

According to the `four-dimensionalist' conception of persons (all all
other objects that persist over time), persons are a lot like their
stories.  Just as my story has a part for my childhood, so {\em I}
have a part consisting just of my childhood.  Just as my story has a
part describing just this instant, so I have a part that is
me-at-this-very-instant \citeyearpar[1]{sider2001}.
\end{squote}

The claim that we have these {\em temporal
  parts}---me-at-this-instant, or me-as-a-child---relies on a close
analogy between space and time.  It is relatively uncontroversial to
claim that we have {\em spatial} parts.  My foot is a part of me, for
instance, but it is not {\em all} of me (it is a proper part, to use
mereological terms).  The philosopher who claims that we have temporal
parts is saying that, likewise, my adulthood is a part of me, but it
is not all of me.  My childhood is---or was, if we do not assume
eternalism---another part of me.  My infancy, childhood, adulthood,
etc. together {\em compose} me.

This theory of temporal parts is often conjoined with a theory about
time.  This theory is commonly referred to as {\em eternalism}.
According to eternalism, ``time is like space.  There is nothing
special about the things here; things at other places are just as
real; no place is metaphysically distinguished.  Similarly, for the
eternalist, there is nothing special about the present; things at
other times are just as real; no time is metaphysically
distinguished'' \citep[122]{hinchliff1996}.  For the eternalist, there
is a sense in which ``there are dinosaurs'' is true.  Everyone agrees
that there are no dinosaurs {\em now}; the question is whether the
dinosaurs of the past still exist {\em in the past}.  

I have no firm intuition on whether either conjunct of the
four-dimensionalist theory is correct.  I do not know whether things
have temporal parts, and I do not know if the past (and future) exist.
Nonetheless I will assume in this section that four-dimensionalism is
true; {\em if} this assumption is correct, we can explain the
existence of ordinary things in new and interesting ways.

\subsection{Four-dimensional essentialism}
\label{4de}
According to four-dimensionalism, ordinary things like chairs and
statues are {\em four-dimensional spacetime worms}.  They are composed
of temporal parts or {\em slices}; a chair might be made up of
`chair-slices' at $t_{1}$, $t_{2}$, $t_{3}$\,\ldots\,, etc.  Depending
on who you ask, these `slices' have a very small temporal duration or
none at all.  If the latter, they are {\em extended} in only three
dimensions; their temporal extension is point-sized (this is what I
will assume).

Four-dimensionalism is very commonly conjoined with universalism---the
theory, defended in section \ref{universe}, that for any things, there
is something composed of them.  If we assume universalism, then
four-dimensionalism entails that for every set of temporal slices,
there is something composed of them.  There is an object composed of
the first ten years of my life, the Kremlin from 1970--1990, and one
second of a puppy's existence in 2020.  This thing is not, of course,
a person; nor is something composed of the first 10 years of my life
and the last ten years of someone else's.  Certain causal or
psychological connections must hold between the temporal parts of a
thing in order for it to be a person.

The objects composed of these temporal slices are mereological sums in
the classical sense.  Let us use `Krupkin' to designate the object
made of the first ten years of my life, the Kremlin from 1970--1990,
and one second of a puppy's existence in 2020.  Because the past and
future exist (we're assuming eternalism), Krupkin always has the same
parts.  Strictly speaking, it doesn't ever change its parts.  In 1991
it is true to say ``the Kremlin is not {\em now} part of Krupkin'',
but it is not true to say ``the Kremlin is not part of Krupkin.

If we assume universalism in addition to four-dimensionalism, then not
only does Krupkin not change its parts, it {\em cannot} change its
parts.  It cannot change its parts for the reason given in section
\ref{change}.  Let us use `Alkin' to designate the object composed of
the first 10 years of my life and the Kremlin from 1970--1990.  Now if
Krupkin could change its parts, it could lose a part.  Suppose it lost
its puppy part.  Then, if it still exists, it would be the object
composed of the first 10 years of my life and the Kremlin from
1970--1990.  But {\em that} object is Alkin; Krupkin would therefore
become identical with Alkin.  Alkin and Krupkin are not identical,
however, because Krupkin has a property that Alkin does not: the
property of having had a puppy as a part.  So Krupkin cannot, in fact,
lose a part; otherwise we would have a contradiction.

Technically, therefore, four-dimensional universalism is a version of
{\em essentialism}---the thesis that things cannot change their parts.
Four-dimensionalists explain change by relativizing things to times:
for a thing to change its color is just for it to have the relation of
being green at one time and red at another, or having a part at one
time and not at another.

I am somewhat sympathetic to this view.  In section \ref{essential} I
will sketch an essentialist theory of things, but one that presupposes
neither temporal parts nor eternalism.  But here I will briefly
examine how a four-dimensionalist essentialism addresses the issues
related to ordinary things that we have been concerned with.

Four-dimensionalism has one major advantage and two disadvantages,
when compared with the three theories above.  The advantage is that
four-dimensionalism does not posits a plurality of {\em kinds} of
things.  The material objects that a four-dimensionalist recognizes
are all mereological sums in the classical sense.  The first
disadvantage is that four-dimensionalism, when conjoined with
universalism, produces a plurality of objects, just as the three
theories above do.  The second disadvantage is that
four-dimensionalism has difficulty distinguishing objects that are
co-located for the entirety of their existence.

\subsection{Four-dimensional solutions}
\label{4ds}
The advantage of four-dimensionalism---that it does not have to posit
a plurality of kinds of things---is primarily an advantage relative to
Fine's two theories.  Fine's theory of embodiments produced\,\ldots

\subsection{Problems for four-dimensionalism}
\label{4dp}
But there are two disadvantages to four-dimensional universalism.  The
first is that four-dimensionalism is just as much a `plurality thesis'
as are the three theories presented above.  Any given temporal slice
is part of a plurality of things.  When I point at my chair, I am also
pointing at a thing composed of my chair and a black bear from the
1800s, as well as a thing composed of my chair and the head of Thomas
Aquinas.  All those things (and {\em many} more) are currently located
in the very same place.

This is certainly bizarre, but it no more {\em disproves}
four-dimensionalism than does it disprove the three theories
previously examined.  Unfortunately there is another disadvantage to
four-dimensionalism, one that does threaten it as a theory.

The second disadvantage of four-dimensionalism is that it has trouble
distinguishing between objects that are co-located for the entirety of
their existence.  Suppose that I have two lumps of clay; I form one
into the top half of a figure and I shape the other into the bottom
half.  Having done this, I stick the two pieces of clay together,
forming a statue.  When I do this I also form a new, larger lump of
clay.  I admire the statue and the lump for a little while, then smash
them with a hammer.

Let $S$ be the thing composed of all the statue-slices.  Let $L$ be
the thing composed of all the larger-lump-slices.  $S$ and $L$ are
mereological sums composed of the very same parts; $S = L$.  But if
the statue had been squashed instead of smashed, $L$ would have
survived; but $S$ would not have survived being squashed.  $L$ has a
property that $S$ does not---the property `could survive being
squashed'---and therefore $S \neq L$.  This is a problem.

The four-dimensionalist could say that the lump would not have
survived being squashed, or that the statue would have survived.
Since there is only one thing under investigation (since $S = L$),
that thing must have a consistent set of properties.  It can't be such
that it would both survive and not survive a squashing.  So the
four-dimensionalist will have to say that one of our two intuitions is
wrong.

But there is another, related, difficulty.  In the case just
presented, the statue is the lump ($S = L$).  But suppose there is a
situation exactly like the one presented, but in which the statue and
lump are first squashed, then smashed.  In this case, we are inclined
to say that the lump $L^{\prime}$ continues to exist after the
squashing.  Its parts include temporal slices of the clay after it has
been squashed.  In the case of the statue $S^{\prime}$, however, we
are inclined to say that the statue does not have any temporal parts
after the squashing.  The statue is destroyed when it is squashed.
Since $L^{\prime}$ and $S^{\prime}$ have different parts, they are not
the same thing; $L^{\prime} \neq S^{\prime}$.  The four-dimensionalist
is committed to the claim that whether there is one thing (a statue
that is also a lump) or two things (a statue and a lump) on the table,
and what that thing's (or those things') modal properties are depends
upon whether I squash or smash it.  This seems highly implausible.  By
choosing to squash the statue rather than smash it, do I thereby {\em
  make it the case} that there were two things, rather than one?

The four-dimensionalist will object that, since the future already
exists, it was {\em already} true that there were two things (it has
always been true).  But claiming that it is already the case that I
will squash the statue seems to commit the four-dimensionalist to some
version of {\em determinism}---the thesis that, roughly, the events of
the future are determined, or fixed, to occur.  This may well be true,
but it is largely an empirical hypothesis; to rely on it here would be
unwise.  (If the four-dimensionalist does not assume determinism, and
instead assumes indeterminism, they will presumably have to say that,
since it is indeterminate whether or not I will squash the statue, the
number of things on the table is therefore also indeterminate.  This
seems even worse.)

\subsection{Moving along}

Four-dimensionalism allows for the resolution of a number of puzzles
related to ordinary things.  It does not resolve everything, however,
and it introduces a few problems of its own.  Moreover, it requires a
number of controversial assumptions: the theory of temporal parts,
eternalism, and possibly determinism.

I will therefore set aside four-dimensionalism, and return to
assessing the relative merits of the three theories above.  One
question that arises for each theory is this: can it explain (or be
supplemented with an explanation) of why we believe things that the
theory denies?

\section{Can the plurality theories explain what we believe?}
\label{explain-p}
In section \ref{stroud} I claimed that a theory that denies that there
are chairs should be supplemented with an explanation of why we
nonetheless believe that there are chairs.

None of the theories I have proposed deny that there are chairs, but
they do make other unexpected claims that conflict with certain of our
beliefs.  Therefore, the theories should be supplemented with
explanations of why we hold these beliefs.

If the plurality thesis is right, why do we believe that there are
chairs when we {\em don't} believe that there are millions of other
objects?  Why, when there is a ten-pound chair in an otherwise empty
room, are we inclined to say that there is just {\em one} thing that
weighs ten pounds?

\subsection{Why do we believe in single things?}
\label{exp-single}
If we want to defend the theory that there are many overlapping things
where we ordinarily believe there to be just one, we should have some
account of why we are generally oblivious to this plurality of
objects.  Why do we think there is {\em just} a chair in the room, and
why do we think there is just a {\em chair} in the room?  What is so
special about the chair that promotes it to our attention out of the
many objects in the room?

One answer might be simply that chairs matter to us more than the
other things.  If the other things mattered as well, we might notice
them too.  The statue matters and the lump matters, so we often notice
both of them.

\section{Lessons}
\label{lessons-p}
We have examined three different theories that account for the
existence of chairs.  Each has the difficult consequence that there
are pluralities of co-located objects.  Once we have admitted that,
for instance, the same matter might compose a statue and a lump, we
have trouble resisting the idea that there might be {\em more} things,
of other kinds, composed of that same matter.  Where we might take
there to be one thing (or maybe two), we now seem committed to there
being a huge number of co-located things.  I believe that this
consequence is a reason to reject each theory and look for an
alternative.

In section \ref{essential} I will sketch an alternative theory.  This
theory identifies chairs and other ordinary things with mereological
sums in the classical sense.  Groups like the Supreme Court will be
identified with sets.  As I have argued, a sum is like a set in that
it does not change its parts.  Therefore when refer to `my chair', I
am referring to a sum.  If I replace the leg on my chair, I henceforth
use `my chair' to refer to a different sum.  Which sum I refer to with
`my chair' will be governed by convention.
